1
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:37,537
<i>Ball one to Johnny Damon
and we are under way.</i>

2
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,622
<i>Damon has eight hits
in 18 at bats...</i>

3
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,291
<i>a double, a triple,
a couple of stolen bases.</i>

4
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,585
<i>He had four hits
in the series opener.</i>

5
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,463
Strike.

6
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:02,061
<i>Down the right-field line,</i>
<i>fair</i> off <i>the bat of Damon.</i>

7
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,147
<i>It rolls by Spencer.</i>

8
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,484
<i>And Damon will coast into
second base with a leadoff double.</i>

9
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:17,243
<i>Into right-center field,
broken bat, it'll fall, a base hit.</i>

10
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,370
<i>They wave around Damon.
He will score.</i>

11
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,831
<i>And Jason Giambi delivers...</i>

12
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,959
<i>with a run-scoring single
here in the opening inning.</i>

13
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,670
<i>And the Athletics
have taken that 1-nothing lead.</i>

14
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,755
Go, come on, now. We gotta spin it.

15
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:42,351
<i>Let's go, Yankees!
Let's go, Yankees!</i>

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,315
<i>Let's go, Yankees!</i>

17
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:48,524
<i>Bases loaded.</i>

18
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:52,862
<i>The Yankees have the tying run
at second, down 2-nothing.</i>

19
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,162
<i>The A's are kicking it and throwing it
all over the field.</i>

20
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,374
<i>And it might lead to their elimination
if they don't get it right in a hurry.</i>

21
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:09,211
<i>Hammered down the right-field line.
Justice!</i>

22
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,089
<i>The Yankees have taken the lead.</i>

23
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,723
<i>They're standing,
anticipating another trip...</i>

24
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,060
<i>to the League
Championship Series.</i>

25
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:26,520
<i>The Yankees one out away.</i>

26
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:32,568
<i>Eric Byrnes, never with an at bat
in Yankee Stadium...</i>

27
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,404
<i>and they don't get much bigger
than this one.</i>

28
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:39,158
<i>Or more hectic when you're up there
trying to get a job done.</i>

29
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,808
<i>And they're a strike away.</i>

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,603
<i>And they're roaring in the Bronx.</i>

31
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:13,859
<i>Losing the first two games at home
in the best-of-five series...</i>

32
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:17,029
<i>and roar back to-</i>-

33
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,384
<i>The Yankees will defend their title.</i>

34
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,696
It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.

35
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,615
- I don't need to watch.
- Joe, leave it on.

36
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:02,825
Okay.

37
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,004
<i>Imagine how bad it'd be
if you were a Yankee player...</i>

38
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,506
<i>and didn't like the taste
of champagne.</i>

39
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,217
<i>Better ask to get traded.</i>

40
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:23,804
<i>You gotta give the Yankees-</i>-

41
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,598
<i>win the big game.</i>

42
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,560
<i>What a series that is gonna be
in the next....</i>

43
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,653
<i>You know how many kids</i>
<i>are wearing Giambi's-</i>-<i>?</i>

44
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,407
<i>You know, Oakland Giambi's jerseys
and hats and pictures and posters?</i>

45
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:47,036
<i>Those same kids will be booing
in July when the Yankees come here.</i>

46
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,457
<i>Is it Giambi that's stabbing the back
or the Pinstripes on the East Coast?</i>

47
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,168
<i>You can't blame them
for pilfering the hen house.</i>

48
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,587
<i>- The hen house is there.
- I can't blame them?</i>

49
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:00,049
<i>They're offering $120 million
over six years.</i>

50
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,886
<i>The Yankees have deeper pockets
and they're willing to give him money.</i>

51
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,679
<i>They're pilfering our players.</i>

52
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:09,225
<i>It's like we're a farm system
for the New York Yankees.</i>

53
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:17,525
- How are the guys doing?
- That was a killer.

54
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,653
That was a killer.
It's a tough one to swallow. It's...

55
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,405
- They played great.
- They played their hearts out.

56
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:26,826
They did. They played fantastic.
It just didn't fall our way.

57
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:29,912
- You'll do better next year.
- But we were close, though.

58
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,122
- We were so close.
- Right there.

59
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,708
Almost had it.
You gotta feel good about that.

60
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,087
I feel great about it.
I feel great about it.

61
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,135
We're not gonna do better next year.

62
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:48,222
- Why not?
- Well, you know we're being gutted.

63
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,352
We're losing Giambi,
Damon, Isringhausen.

64
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,105
Done deal. We're in trouble.

65
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,567
You'll find new guys.
You found Jason, you found Damon.

66
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,861
- I need more money, Steve.
- Billy.

67
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:04,196
- I need more money.
- We don't have any.

68
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,949
I can't compete against $120 million
with $38 million.

69
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,452
We're not gonna compete with
these teams that have big budgets.

70
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:13,289
We're gonna work
within the constraints we have...

71
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:17,209
and you're gonna do the best job
that you can recruiting new players.

72
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,628
We're not gonna pay $17 million
to players.

73
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,006
I'm not asking you...

74
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,967
for 10 or 20, 30 million dollars.

75
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,927
I'm just asking for a bit of help.

76
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:30,764
Get me a little closer and I will get you
that championship team.

77
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:35,185
I mean, this is why I'm here.
This is why you hired me.

78
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:39,189
And I gotta ask you,
what are we doing here...

79
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,984
- Billy, I...
- if it's not to win a championship?

80
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,571
- I wanna win just as much...
- That's my bar. My bar is here.

81
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,657
My bar is to take this team
to the championship.

82
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:53,621
Billy, we're a small-market team,
and you're a small-market GM.

83
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:58,667
I'm asking you to be okay
not spending money that I don't have.

84
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:01,337
And I'm asking you
to take a deep breath...

85
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:05,007
shake off the loss,
get back in a room with your guys...

86
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,719
and figure out how to find
replacements for the guys we lost...

87
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,804
with the money that we do have.

88
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:16,310
I'm not leaving here. I'm not...
I can't leave here with that.

89
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,521
What else can I help you with?

90
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,077
<i>It's a good offer,
and you gotta match it. I...</i>

91
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:34,912
I need another day.

92
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,374
<i>His mind's pretty made up.
I just think you should know that.</i>

93
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,336
- I got a call. I'll get you back.
<i>- I'll let him know.</i>

94
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,171
Bye.

95
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:47,091
- Yeah?
<i>- Billy, Scott.</i>

96
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:49,677
- <i>Just got off the phone with Dan.</i>
- You didn't.

97
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,387
<i>I was surprised he called me.</i>

98
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:54,723
Stop. I got Johnny for 7.5
or he doesn't play anywhere else.

99
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,687
- That's the deal you made.
- <i>Boston just upped it to 7. 75.</i>

100
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:03,065
<i>You there?</i>

101
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:08,654
- We had a deal, Scott.
<i>- We have a deal, if it's 8 million.</i>

102
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,074
- Oh, man, you played me.
<i>- I'm just doing my job for my client.</i>

103
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,910
No, you're playing me,
and you're still playing me.

104
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,663
Congratulations, asshole. You win.

105
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:27,715
I like guys that got a little hair
on their ass.

106
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:30,676
He looks like a Mantle or a Mays,
quite frankly.

107
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,595
- He's got a baseball body.
- Matty, who do you got?

108
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:35,764
- I like Geronimo.
- Yes.

109
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:39,309
The guy's an athlete.
Big, fast, talented.

110
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,562
- Top of my list.
- Clean-cut, good face.

111
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,439
- Yeah, good jaw.
- Five-tools guy.

112
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:45,566
- Good-looking ballplayer.
- Can he hit?

113
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,861
- He's got a beautiful swing.
- The ball explodes off his bat.

114
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,156
He throws the club head at the ball,
and when he connects...

115
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,575
he drives it, it pops off the bat.

116
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,037
- You can hear it all over the ballpark.
- A lot of pop.

117
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,289
If he's good,
why doesn't he hit good?

118
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,416
- He is a good hitter.
- He'll be ready.

119
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,294
He's gonna be a good hitter
against big-league arms?

120
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,254
- Could be great.
- I don't think so.

121
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,716
Kid needs at bats. Give him
400 at bats, he's gonna get better.

122
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,802
- He can play.
- He's hit everywhere along the line.

123
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:15,721
He's one of our guys.

124
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:23,562
Okay, let's move on.

125
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:28,150
- Artie, who do you like?
- I like Perez. He's got a classic swing.

126
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,820
- It's a real clean stroke.
- I don't know. Can't hit the curveball.

127
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:35,491
There's some work to be done,
I'll admit that, but he's noticeable.

128
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:37,951
- Got an ugly girlfriend.
- What's that mean?

129
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:40,162
Ugly girlfriend
means no confidence.

130
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,665
You are full of it. Artie is right.
This guy's got an attitude.

131
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,084
An attitude is good.

132
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,712
He walks in a room, his dick's already
been there for two minutes.

133
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,173
He passes the eye-candy test.
Got the looks.

134
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,259
He's ready to play the part.
He just needs playing time.

135
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,970
I'm just saying,
his girlfriend is a six at best.

136
00:09:57,137 --> 00:10:00,349
Look, if we're trying to replace Giambi,
this guy could be it.

137
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,184
I agree with you.

138
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,356
Damn, Billy, was that a suggestion?

139
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:10,275
Guys, you're just talking.

140
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:14,363
Talking... like this is business
as usual.

141
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,989
It's not.

142
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,575
We're trying to solve the problem.

143
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:21,286
Not like this.
You're not looking at the problem.

144
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:23,580
We're very aware of the problem.
I mean...

145
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:26,250
Okay, good. What's the problem?

146
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,216
Look, Billy,
we all understand what the problem is.

147
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,802
- We have to...
- Okay, good. What's the problem?

148
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,721
We have to replace three key players
in our lineup.

149
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:41,390
Nope. What's the problem?

150
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,143
We gotta replace these guys
with what we have...

151
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:46,019
No. What's the problem, Barry?

152
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:50,816
We need 38 home runs, 120 RBIs
and 47 doubles to replace.

153
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,570
The problem we're trying to solve
is that there are rich teams...

154
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:58,574
and there are poor teams,
then there's 50 feet of crap...

155
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,909
and then there's us.

156
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,246
It's an unfair game.

157
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:11,211
And now we've been gutted.
We're like organ donors for the rich.

158
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:14,423
Boston's taken our kidneys,
Yankees have taken our heart.

159
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,966
And you guys sit around...

160
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:21,180
talking the same old "good body"
nonsense like we're selling jeans.

161
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:23,599
Like we're looking for Fabio.

162
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:25,851
We got to think differently.

163
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,521
We are the last dog at the bowl.

164
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,691
You see what happens to the runt
of the litter? He dies.

165
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,445
Billy, that's a very touching story
and everything...

166
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,032
but I think we're all very much aware
of what we're facing.

167
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,118
You have a lot of experience
and wisdom in this room.

168
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:47,456
You need to have a little faith and
let us do the job of replacing Giambi.

169
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,083
Is there another first baseman
like Giambi?

170
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,293
- No, not really.
- No.

171
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,296
- If there was, could we afford him?
- Nope.

172
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,966
Then what the fuck
are you talking about, man?

173
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,803
If we try to play like the Yankees
in here...

174
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,806
we will lose to the Yankees
out there.

175
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:08,936
Boy, that sounds like
fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy.

176
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,648
- No, that's just logic.
- Who's Fabio?

177
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:15,484
He's a shortstop.
He's a shortstop from Seattle.

178
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,278
Now, this is no time
to push the panic button.

179
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,949
Our scouts will find players,
Player Development will develop them.

180
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:24,493
We'll teach them
to play Oakland A baseball.

181
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,621
With all due respect,
we've been doing this a long time.

182
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,124
Why don't you just let us
be responsible for replacing Giambi...

183
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,877
with who we know that can play?

184
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,395
- Easy power.
- And loose.

185
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,105
Good face.

186
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,827
This son of a bitch
is going in the first round.

187
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,246
<i>You're a premium player, Billy.</i>

188
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,374
<i>You can run, you can field,
you can throw, you can hit...</i>

189
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,167
<i>you can hit with power.</i>

190
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,211
<i>That doesn't come along very often.</i>

191
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,714
This is Tom Martinez,
national cross-checker.

192
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,341
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.
- Billy Beane.

193
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:25,679
It's been a while since I've seen
a five-tool guy that can do everything.

194
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,890
<i>I'm hopeful your interest
in professional baseball...</i>

195
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:33,770
<i>is as strong as ours is gonna be
in getting you in this upcoming draft.</i>

196
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,945
Mr. Beane?

197
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,740
Mark is ready to see you now.

198
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:52,873
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

199
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,082
- How are you?
- Good.

200
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,836
- Hey, Billy.
- Hey, Mark.

201
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,839
- Good to see you. Please sit down.
- You too.

202
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,926
- These are the guys. Guys, Billy.
- Boys.

203
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,596
- How's it going?
- All right. How you been?

204
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,683
- You're filling out that chair nicely.
- I got three weeks in it right now.

205
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,893
Good, good, man.

206
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,562
- Yeah, man. How you doing?
- Fantastic.

207
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,314
- Awesome.
- Couldn't be better.

208
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,192
That's good to hear.
I'm not gonna waste your time.

209
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,486
You just tell me
what you're looking for.

210
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:24,946
Fifty million dollars
in additional payroll.

211
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:26,573
You should try Giambi.

212
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,911
I'm sorry. Too soon, right?
I want this to be a friendly meeting.

213
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,704
It's not all on your shoulders.

214
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,915
- Where's Steve in this?
- Steve's great.

215
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,125
He's supportive
in rebuilding this team.

216
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,794
That's what we're gonna do.

217
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,963
- So, what are you looking for?
- A left-handed reliever.

218
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,966
I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon.

219
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,302
That's not gonna happen.

220
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,597
Not even a discussion?

221
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:55,769
Billy, even if you could afford him,
respectfully, we love him.

222
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,896
We're not about to let him go.

223
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,065
You got this Venezuelan kid
coming up.

224
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,567
We had him.
We moved him to Detroit.

225
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,320
What else you thinking?

226
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,073
Outfielders.

227
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,951
- To replace Damon?
- Yeah.

228
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:15,789
- In your price range? No disrespect.
- Enough, Mark.

229
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,500
Hollins?

230
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,130
- Garcia?
- No.

231
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,006
Maybe Coste.

232
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,511
That's it.

233
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,182
- All right, tell me about Garcia.
- To replace Johnny Damon?

234
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,853
- Mark, is he healthy?
- Yeah, he's healthy-ish.

235
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,480
He had that back thing.

236
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:43,400
- He'll be ready for spring ball.
- I'll tell you what.

237
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,069
I can give you Guthrie
if you kick in some cash.

238
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,320
- Mark Guthrie?
- Yeah.

239
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:49,614
- How much cash?
- Two hundred K.

240
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,382
Okay.

241
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:12,220
- So Garcia's gonna be a no.
- You're kidding me, right?

242
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,474
- You're kidding me.
- I'm not.

243
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,395
Okay. Straight up, Garcia for Guthrie,
no kicker.

244
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,065
- No kicker?
- Straight up.

245
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:32,032
I think it's gonna be a hard no
on Garcia, but let's just keep going.

246
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,410
- What else you thinking?
- What are we doing? Is this business?

247
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,871
This is the way we do business
in Cleveland.

248
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,083
Hey.

249
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,795
- Hello.
- Who are you?

250
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,633
I'm Peter Brand.

251
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,261
What do you do?

252
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,223
I'm special assistant
to Mark Shapiro.

253
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,267
So, what do you do?

254
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,106
Mostly player analysis right now.

255
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,985
Been on the job long?
First job in baseball?

256
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,822
It's my first job anywhere.

257
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,449
- Wow, congrats.
- Thank you.

258
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:59,244
First job. Whose nephew are you?

259
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,498
Why does Mark listen to you?

260
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,961
I don't think...

261
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,006
I don't think he does very often.

262
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,342
He just did.

263
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,971
Well, in that circumstance...

264
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,683
I think he was more listening
to Bruce than myself.

265
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,686
Who are you?

266
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,649
I'm Peter Brand.

267
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:35,697
I don't give a rat's ass
what your name is.

268
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,575
What happened in there?

269
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,995
What happened in that room?

270
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,123
I'm not quite sure
what you're asking me, Mr. Beane.

271
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,709
What did you tell Bruce?

272
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:53,381
- I just told Bruce I like Garcia.
- You like Garcia. Why?

273
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,385
Why?

274
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,975
I don't know.

275
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:24,454
There is an epidemic failure
within the game...

276
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,248
to understand
what is really happening.

277
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:31,878
And this leads people who run
Major League Baseball teams...

278
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:36,216
to misjudge their players
and mismanage their teams.

279
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,764
I apologize.

280
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:44,766
Go on.

281
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:53,191
Okay. People who run ball clubs,
they think in terms of buying players.

282
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:58,363
Your goal shouldn't be to buy players.
Your goal should be to buy wins.

283
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,908
And in order to buy wins,
you need to buy runs.

284
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,119
You're trying
to replace Johnny Damon.

285
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:06,246
<i>The Red Sox see Johnny Damon...</i>

286
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:10,083
<i>and they see a star
who's worth $7.5 million a year.</i>

287
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,128
When I see Johnny Damon...

288
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:15,630
what I see is...

289
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:20,468
an imperfect understanding
of where runs come from.

290
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,804
<i>The guy's got a great glove.</i>

291
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,932
<i>He's a decent leadoff hitter.
He can steal bases.</i>

292
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,476
But is he worth the $7.5 million
a year...

293
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,812
that the Boston Red Sox
are paying him?

294
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,814
No. No.

295
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,275
<i>Baseball thinking is medieval.</i>

296
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,944
<i>They are asking
all the wrong questions.</i>

297
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:42,282
And if I say it to anybody,
I'm ostracized. I'm a leper.

298
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:47,412
So that's why I'm cagey
about this with you.

299
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,621
That's why...

300
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:52,709
I respect you, Mr. Beane,
and if you want full disclosure...

301
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:57,756
I think it's a good thing
that you got Damon off your payroll.

302
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:02,469
I think it opens up all kinds
of interesting possibilities.

303
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:05,722
- Where you from, Pete?
- Maryland.

304
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,184
- Where'd you go to school?
- Yale. I went to Yale.

305
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,188
- What'd you study?
- Economics.

306
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,399
I studied economics.

307
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:24,324
Yale, economics and baseball.

308
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,119
You're funny, Pete.

309
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:52,227
<i>Tell me, why Billy?</i>

310
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:55,355
What is it that makes him special?

311
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,234
Very rare do you come upon
a young man like Billy...

312
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,529
who can run, who can field,
who can throw, who can hit...

313
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:04,280
and who can hit with power.

314
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:07,492
Those five tools,
you don't see that very often.

315
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,079
Most of the youngsters
that we have an interest in...

316
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,705
have one or two tools...

317
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:15,500
and we're hoping
to develop an extra one.

318
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,585
Your son has five.

319
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:21,798
We're looking at a guy that's a
potential superstar for us in New York.

320
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,842
The time is now to get him started.

321
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:26,845
We're prepared to make
a sizable financial commitment.

322
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,430
The Mets are gonna
stand behind Billy...

323
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:32,934
because we expect him
to be our big-league center fielder.

324
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,186
This check here
represents the offer...

325
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,731
that the New York Mets
would be making to Billy.

326
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:44,028
You do know that he's been accepted
to Stanford on a full scholarship?

327
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:45,363
I do.

328
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,949
So he can do both?

329
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:52,453
Unfortunately, he can't do Stanford
and professional baseball.

330
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,541
He would have to pick one
or the other.

331
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,210
If he wants to be center fielder
for the Mets...

332
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,254
wants to be a baseball player...

333
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:06,301
he really needs to accept this
as life's first occupation, first career.

334
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:10,221
We're all told at some point we can
no longer play the children's game.

335
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,891
We just don't know
when that's gonna be.

336
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:17,478
Some of us are told at 18, some of us
are told at 40, but we're all told.

337
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:21,316
<i>But this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.</i>

338
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:22,567
We want you badly...

339
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,070
and we think that this amount
of money expresses that desire.

340
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:29,616
Billy, this is your decision,
and whatever that decision is...

341
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:32,285
<i>you know it's fine
with your mother and I.</i>

342
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,423
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's Billy Beane.

343
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:50,011
- Hey, what time is it?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

344
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,141
Listen, would you have drafted me
in the first round?

345
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,726
<i>What?</i>

346
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,438
After I left,
you looked me up on your computer.

347
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,941
Would you have drafted me
in the first round?

348
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:06,027
<i>I did, yeah.
You were a good player.</i>

349
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,446
Cut the crap, man.

350
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,532
Would you have drafted me
in the first round?

351
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,371
<i>I'd have taken you in the ninth round.
No signing bonus.</i>

352
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:21,709
<i>I imagine you would've passed
and taken that scholarship.</i>

353
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,295
Yeah.

354
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:30,385
<i>Pack your bags, Pete.</i>

355
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,846
I just bought you
from the Cleveland Indians.

356
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:51,072
- Is it attached to that clamp?
- Yeah, let me unhook it.

357
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,083
- Slide it up right there. To the left.
- I did.

358
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,419
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hang on, it's wet.

359
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:06,170
Come on.

360
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:29,736
- Morning, Suzanne. Coffee on?
- Yes.

361
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:31,279
Great.

362
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,740
- Billy Beane's office.
- Hey.

363
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:34,949
- Peter Brand.
- Billy.

364
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,618
- How are...? Hi, how you doing?
- Nice to see you.

365
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:40,371
Good to have you here.
Boy, you move in fast.

366
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,416
Yeah, yeah.
I got here early this morning.

367
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:47,086
- All moved in.
- Yeah.

368
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:49,380
Yeah.

369
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,549
Hey, Billy...

370
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,635
I wanted you
to see these player evaluations...

371
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:56,971
that you asked me to do.

372
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,557
I asked you to do three.

373
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,809
Yeah.

374
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:04,562
- To evaluate three players.
- Yeah.

375
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,689
How many did you do?

376
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,816
Forty-seven.

377
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,277
Okay.

378
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,907
Actually, 51.
I don't know why I lied just then.

379
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,335
Why don't you walk me
through the board?

380
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,379
Thank you.

381
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,699
Using this equation
in the upper left...

382
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:01,994
I'm projecting that we need to win
at least 99 games...

383
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:04,330
in order to make it
to the postseason.

384
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:08,626
We need to score at least 814 runs
in order to win those games...

385
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,879
and allow no more than 645 runs.

386
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,302
<i>What's this?</i>

387
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:22,056
<i>This is a code that I've written
for our year-to-year projections.</i>

388
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,893
<i>This is building in the intelligence
that we have to project players.</i>

389
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,061
<i>Okay.</i>

390
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,897
<i>It's about getting things down
to one number.</i>

391
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:32,900
<i>Using the stats
the way we read them...</i>

392
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:36,237
<i>we'll find value in players
that nobody else can see.</i>

393
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,075
<i>People are overlooked...</i>

394
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:45,037
<i>for a variety of biased reasons
and perceived flaws.</i>

395
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:48,499
<i>Age, appearance, personality.</i>

396
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:53,421
<i>Bill James and mathematics
cut straight through that.</i>

397
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,301
<i>Billy, of the 20, 000 notable players
for us to consider...</i>

398
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:01,012
<i>I believe
that there is a championship team...</i>

399
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,348
of 25 people that we can afford...

400
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:07,685
because everyone else in baseball
undervalues them.

401
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,105
Like an island of misfit toys.

402
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,779
<i>Billy, this is Chad Bradford.</i>
<i>He's a relief pitcher.</i>

403
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:23,242
<i>He is one of the most undervalued
players in baseball.</i>

404
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:26,370
<i>His defect is that he throws funny.</i>

405
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,292
<i>Nobody in the big leagues cares
about him because he looks funny.</i>

406
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,545
<i>This guy could be not just
the best pitcher in our pen...</i>

407
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:38,132
<i>but one of the most effective
relief pitchers in all baseball.</i>

408
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,052
<i>This guy should cost $3 million
a year.</i>

409
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,096
<i>We can get him for 237, 000.</i>

410
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:09,455
Billy.

411
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,376
- That it?
- Yeah.

412
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,865
Hey, Art.

413
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:47,243
Can I talk to you
before you get started?

414
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,870
- I'm a bit busy right now.
- I know.

415
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:53,332
- I know.
- Okay.

416
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:55,167
- Morning, everyone.
- Art.

417
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:58,587
- Peter Brand. Nice to meet you.
- Where the hell's Pete?

418
00:29:58,754 --> 00:29:59,839
That's Pete.

419
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,217
Grab a seat. I'll be right back.

420
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,638
- All right, where did you say he's at?
- Okay. He's on...

421
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:11,017
- Who's the kid?
- A friend of mine.

422
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:15,730
I can't manage this team
under a one-year contract.

423
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:17,690
Well, sure you can.

424
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,527
No, I can't.

425
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,238
Okay. I gotta put a team on the field.

426
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,908
After that, I'll take a good long look
at your contract.

427
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:31,370
Deal with the manager's contract,
then put a team on the field.

428
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:35,916
At this moment, if a grounder's hit
to first, nobody's there to stop it.

429
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:41,088
It's not easy doing what I do
under the cloud of a one-year contract.

430
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:42,673
Okay, I understand that.

431
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,800
- I've been there.
- I know you have.

432
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:49,430
A one-year contract means the same
thing to a manager as to a player.

433
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,766
There's not a lot of faith there.

434
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,727
Which is strange
after a 102-win season.

435
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,730
I see.

436
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:02,234
If you lose the last game
of the season, nobody gives a shit.

437
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:08,115
- So it's on me now?
- No, Art, it's on me.

438
00:31:08,282 --> 00:31:11,619
And the kid is the new assistant GM.

439
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,788
- Okay.
- Okay, fellas.

440
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:15,623
Hey, Billy.

441
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:28,719
You can't deny his offensive output.
He can play.

442
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,889
And we need people that can play.

443
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,481
Who do you wanna talk about first?

444
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,250
None of them.

445
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,962
Billy, we got 38 home runs,
120 RBIs to make up for.

446
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,506
Guys, you're still trying
to replace Giambi.

447
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:09,176
I told you we can't do it,
and we can't do it.

448
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:13,931
Now, what we might be able to do
is re-create him.

449
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,101
- Re-create him in the aggregate.
- The what?

450
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,020
Giambi's on-base percentage
was .477.

451
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:24,650
Damon's on-base, .324.
And Olmedo's was .291.

452
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,027
Add that up and you get...

453
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,990
Do you want me to speak?

454
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:33,868
When I point at you, yeah.

455
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:36,996
- 1 .092.
- Divided by three.

456
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,915
- .364.
- That's what we're looking for.

457
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:44,211
Three ballplayers... Three ballplayers
whose average OBP is...

458
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:45,713
.364.

459
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,757
- Wait, that doesn't come out right.
- It's right, Artie.

460
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:51,218
- Billy.
- You gotta carry the one.

461
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:53,762
- Billy.
- Scratch this out.

462
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:56,765
- Yeah?
- Who's that?

463
00:32:56,932 --> 00:32:58,559
That's Pete.

464
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:03,230
- Does Pete really need to be here?
- Yes, he does.

465
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,234
Okay, here's who we want.

466
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:10,654
Number one:
Jason's little brother, Jeremy.

467
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:13,699
- Oh, God.
- Billy, that's trouble.

468
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,618
Billy, look, if I... Yeah.

469
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:18,746
Billy, if I may,
he has had his problems off the field...

470
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,248
and we know what he can't do
on the field.

471
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:23,334
He's getting thick around the waist.

472
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,170
There's reports about him on weed,
in strip clubs.

473
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,006
His on-base percentage
is all we're looking at now.

474
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:34,595
And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot
for a guy who only costs 285,000.

475
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,765
- Jeez, Billy...
- Number two:

476
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:41,268
- David Justice.
- Oh, no.

477
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:43,312
- His legs are gone.
- Not a good idea.

478
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,105
- Old Man Justice?
- Why is that?

479
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:47,441
Steinbrenner's so pissed
at his decline...

480
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,402
he's willing to eat his contract
to get rid of him.

481
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:53,280
- Exactly.
- Ten years ago, Justice, big name.

482
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:54,490
Been in big games.

483
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,910
He's gonna really help
our season tickets early in the year...

484
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:02,706
but in the dog days in July, August,
we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.

485
00:34:02,873 --> 00:34:06,544
Billy, his legs are gone,
and he's a defensive liability.

486
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,879
I question
whether the bat speed's there.

487
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:10,422
- His legs are gone.
- Grady.

488
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:14,593
We'll be lucky to get 60 games
out of him. Why do you like him?

489
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,971
Because he gets on base.

490
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,558
- What is this?
- What are we doing?

491
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:22,810
Okay, number three:

492
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,568
- Scott Hatteberg.
- Who?

493
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:31,819
- Hatteberg?
- Exactly.

494
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,821
He sounds like an Oakland A
already.

495
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,992
- Yes, he's had a little problem with...
- Little problem? He can't throw.

496
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:41,829
He's a career .260 hitter.
The best part of his career is over.

497
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,790
- It's just getting started.
- Boston wants to cut him.

498
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,501
- No one wants to pick him up.
- Good. He's cheap.

499
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,337
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna get a guy...

500
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:53,841
that's been released
by half the organizations in baseball...

501
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,178
because he's got non-repairable nerve
damage in his elbow and can't throw.

502
00:34:58,345 --> 00:35:01,682
He can't throw and he can't field.
But what can he do?

503
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,891
Oh, boy.

504
00:35:03,058 --> 00:35:05,477
Check your reports
or I'm gonna point at Pete.

505
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:08,147
- He gets on base.
- He can get on base.

506
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,899
- So he walks a lot.
- He gets on base a lot, Rocco.

507
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:13,694
Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?

508
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,237
Pete?

509
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,656
- You do not.
- I do not.

510
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:20,868
I got 37 free agents
that are better than those three guys.

511
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,287
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

512
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,123
So you're not gonna bring in one...

513
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,627
but three defective players
to replace Giambi?

514
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,838
You're not buying into
this Bill James bullshit?

515
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,965
This is the new direction of the A's.

516
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:38,052
We are card counters
at the blackjack table...

517
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:40,929
and we're gonna turn the odds
on the casino.

518
00:35:42,264 --> 00:35:44,016
- I don't see it.
- Seriously, guys.

519
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,894
I think we have to remember
this is the man.

520
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:52,483
He answers to no one
except ownership and God.

521
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,527
And he doesn't have to answer
to us.

522
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:58,113
We make suggestions,
he makes decisions.

523
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,700
That's all fine and well, but we've been
working our asses off...

524
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:05,704
for weeks to make this club better,
and you're shitting all over it.

525
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,374
This is not a discussion.

526
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,088
- What are we discussing?
- Barry, not a discussion.

527
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,762
Billy, man...

528
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:24,682
there's one thing you're forgetting.

529
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:30,020
None of those three guys
knows how to play first base.

530
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:32,523
Well, you're gonna have
to teach one of them.

531
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,108
Teach?

532
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,944
Which one?

533
00:36:48,455 --> 00:36:52,376
<i>This is really the kickoff to the holiday
season here in downtown Seattle.</i>

534
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,002
<i>It took weeks of planning...</i>

535
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:57,131
<i>to lead up to the big event,
but it was well worth it.</i>

536
00:36:57,297 --> 00:37:00,759
<i>The weather was ideal.
People are still having a great time.</i>

537
00:37:00,926 --> 00:37:02,803
<i>Thousands of people
were out earlier.</i>

538
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,638
<i>We have a nice recap for you...</i>

539
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,809
<i>of all the great events taking place
downtown in Seattle...</i>

540
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:13,981
- Hello?
<i>- Scott?</i>

541
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,149
Yes.

542
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:18,318
<i>- It's Billy Beane of the Oakland A's</i>
- Yes.

543
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:21,363
<i>- Can we talk?</i>
- Yeah.

544
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,490
<i>Do you wanna let us in?</i>

545
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:27,035
- Pardon me?
<i>- We're out front.</i>

546
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:30,664
- What?
<i>- On the curb.</i>

547
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,624
Yeah, yeah.

548
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,627
Honey?

549
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,009
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

550
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,844
Very kind.

551
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:49,183
How's the elbow, Scott?

552
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:52,686
You know, it's good.
It's really good. It's great.

553
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:01,361
- I can't throw the ball at all.
- Yeah.

554
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:04,239
You've thrown your last ball
from behind home plate.

555
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:06,617
- That's what I'd say.
- Well...

556
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,621
Good news is, we want you at first.

557
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,465
We want you to play first base
for the Oakland A's.

558
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,843
Okay, well...

559
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,762
I've only ever played catcher.

560
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,389
Scott, you're not a catcher anymore.

561
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,894
If you were, our call wouldn't
have been the only one you got.

562
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,982
- Yeah. Hey, listen, no, I appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

563
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:43,904
- But the thing is, is...
- You don't know how to play first base.

564
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,572
- Scott.
- That's right.

565
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,658
It's not that hard, Scott.

566
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,035
- Tell him, Wash.
- It's incredibly hard.

567
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,372
Hey, anything worth doing is.
And we're gonna teach you.

568
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,874
Wait a minute here.
I mean, but what about...?

569
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,168
Jason's gone, Scott.

570
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,171
You want me to take Giambi's spot
at first base?

571
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:02,756
- Yeah.
- What about the fans?

572
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,260
- Maybe I can teach one of them.
- The fans don't... Good one.

573
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:10,180
- Fans don't run my ball club.
- Honey, what are you doing awake?

574
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,933
Sweetheart, can you...?

575
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,894
That's my daughter.

576
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,231
You got kids?

577
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:22,025
Yeah, a daughter.

578
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:26,613
Scott, this is a contract to play ball
for the Oakland A's.

579
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,866
A copy's been sent over
to your agent.

580
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:31,910
Discuss with your wife, let us know.

581
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,162
Thank you.

582
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:35,622
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

583
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:37,791
- Oh, and, Scott.
- Yeah?

584
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,294
Don't tell anyone
about the first-base thing.

585
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,461
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

586
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:44,131
- Happy holidays.
- All right.

587
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,991
- Hey, Sharon.
- Hi, Billy.

588
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,411
- Is she ready?
- She's out with friends.

589
00:40:15,495 --> 00:40:17,623
But she'll be back. Come in.

590
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,667
- Okay.
- Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.

591
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,169
Here you go.

592
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,925
- Here, wanna have a seat?
- Yeah.

593
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:38,852
- You good, Billy?
- Yeah. How are you, Alan?

594
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,397
Good. Really good.
Things are peaceful around here.

595
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:46,526
It's good to see you.

596
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:48,654
Thanks, Alan.

597
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,948
I haven't got to see you
since play-offs.

598
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:53,617
I wanted to say
that New York was heartbreaking.

599
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:55,661
I'm sure for you too.

600
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:59,790
Not many teams make it that far,
and to watch you go that far was...

601
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:05,462
- It was really an accomplishment.
- Well, that's nice.

602
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:08,548
How is the team shaping up?

603
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:12,469
- Team's good. Rebuilding.
- Good.

604
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,722
I read you lost Giambonni
and Damon.

605
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:16,890
- Giambi.
- Giambi.

606
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,726
- Yeah.
- Damon, Isringhausen.

607
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:23,897
- They're really...? They're gone?
- Gone. Yesterday's news.

608
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,442
- That's terrible.
- No, but that is a tough situation.

609
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:29,236
That's...

610
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,781
You're gonna be fine, though.
You always figure something out.

611
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:39,913
Where is she? Where was she?
Down the street or...?

612
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,084
Oh, sorry, yeah. I just talked to her
on her cell. She's coming up the hill.

613
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,544
Okay.

614
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,921
She's got a cell phone?

615
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,008
- Yeah.
- A 12-year-old?

616
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:52,676
Yeah.

617
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:56,763
For emergencies.

618
00:41:58,765 --> 00:42:00,934
Big parenting decision.

619
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:05,564
But it's something that, you know,
we, you know, all should discuss...

620
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,192
because if you have any objections,
of course...

621
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,820
Her mother and I will discuss it.

622
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,406
But thank you.

623
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,244
Any of these?

624
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,371
I don't know.

625
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,582
- Do you...?
- This one's cool.

626
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,377
- Is that good or bad? Butterflies.
- They're okay.

627
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:32,299
- Look, that one's pretty. I like the red.
- Should we try?

628
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,301
No?

629
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,094
- Oh, I like this one.
- Yeah?

630
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:37,637
Dad, look at this one.

631
00:42:37,804 --> 00:42:40,098
- Look how it's red.
- It's beautiful.

632
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:42,642
- This one's pretty.
- Let's try it out.

633
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:45,187
- Just right here?
- Why don't we go over there?

634
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:46,897
Can we go over there?

635
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:09,503
Oh, honey, you need to sing.
That's so good.

636
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:12,339
That's beautiful.

637
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:14,925
Sometimes I sing.

638
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:20,764
It's fun to sing with your song,
but I don't want people to listen to me.

639
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,810
Well, honey, I think people would love
to listen to you. That's beautiful.

640
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,897
Would you sing a little for your dad?

641
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,191
Right here
in the middle of the store?

642
00:43:34,027 --> 00:43:36,446
- Little bit.
- Little bit.

643
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,908
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

644
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,326
Okay.

645
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:19,030
<i>Billy Beane was taken
in the first round of the amateur draft.</i>

646
00:44:19,197 --> 00:44:21,449
<i>I think this is a steal,
to get Billy Beane.</i>

647
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:23,160
<i>He's young, he's talented.</i>

648
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:27,664
<i>A true five-tool player with speed.
This guy is a can't-miss prospect.</i>

649
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,083
<i>This is a great sign
for the New York Mets.</i>

650
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,712
<i>And it could be the turnaround
that they've been looking for.</i>

651
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,589
Ball one.

652
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:38,300
<i>I'll take Billy Beane
over Strawberry.</i>

653
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:41,887
<i>Billy Beane, an interesting pick,
turned down a scholarship.</i>

654
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:43,597
<i>He could've gone to Stanford.</i>

655
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:47,100
<i>Sometimes you don't find out
till you get to the big leagues....</i>

656
00:44:48,226 --> 00:44:51,897
<i>This guy has never failed at anything.
He's coming out of high school.</i>

657
00:44:52,063 --> 00:44:55,692
<i>Billy was gonna go to college.
He could've been a great quarterback.</i>

658
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,410
Strike three.

659
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:09,247
<i>There's not an organization
in baseball...</i>

660
00:45:09,414 --> 00:45:15,086
<i>who would not have taken a chance
on this young guy.</i>

661
00:45:15,795 --> 00:45:19,216
<i>He didn't pan out.
That happens every year.</i>

662
00:45:20,675 --> 00:45:23,511
<i>Some do, some don't.</i>

663
00:45:24,804 --> 00:45:27,724
<i>I mean, if you're having any doubt
at all about this....</i>

664
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,645
<i>Having the scholarship.</i>...

665
00:45:31,811 --> 00:45:34,898
<i>Your son was born
with a God-given ability.</i>

666
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:39,277
<i>Few scouts can go into the mind
of a young man...</i>

667
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:42,656
<i>and determine
whether he's really confident...</i>

668
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:44,115
<i>about what he can do.</i>

669
00:45:44,282 --> 00:45:45,992
<i>A very special player.</i>

670
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:48,787
<i>So you can sign him
based on his ability...</i>

671
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:52,499
<i>but then he's gotta be successful
to be confident.</i>

672
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:57,337
<i>And once he becomes confident,
that's when you've got something.</i>

673
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:04,010
<i>You make a decision
on what you see.</i>

674
00:46:04,177 --> 00:46:07,722
<i>And if things don't pan out,
you move on.</i>

675
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:09,933
<i>That's baseball.</i>

676
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,143
<i>Many are called, few are chosen.</i>

677
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:18,775
Billy, that is Kevin Youkilis.
That is the Greek God of Walks.

678
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,277
That's my hero.

679
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:23,446
That man gets walked
more than anybody in baseball...

680
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:25,532
except for Barry Bonds.

681
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:29,202
I tried to convince Shapiro
to pick him up last June...

682
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,746
but he said he waddled
like a duck.

683
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,457
Yeah, Boston snagged him.

684
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:36,543
I think they wanna wait and see.

685
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:46,720
- Are you okay, Billy?
- Billy?

686
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:51,516
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Yeah.

687
00:47:01,901 --> 00:47:04,696
You're unhappy, Grady. Why?

688
00:47:10,618 --> 00:47:12,912
- May I speak candidly?
- Sure, go ahead.

689
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,958
Major League Baseball and its fans,
they're gonna be more than happy...

690
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,586
to throw you and Google Boy
under the bus...

691
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,755
if you keep doing
what you're doing.

692
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:24,299
You don't put a team together
with a computer.

693
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,217
- No?
- No.

694
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:29,095
Baseball isn't just numbers.
It's not science.

695
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:32,432
If it was, anybody could do
what we're doing, but they can't.

696
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,351
They don't know what we know.

697
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:37,604
They don't have our experience
and our intuition.

698
00:47:38,104 --> 00:47:39,230
Okay.

699
00:47:39,814 --> 00:47:43,276
You got a kid in there that's got
a degree in economics from Yale.

700
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,613
You got a scout here
with 29 years of baseball experience.

701
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,366
You're listening to the wrong one.

702
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:53,370
Now, there are intangibles
that only baseball people understand.

703
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:56,790
You're discounting
what scouts have done for 150 years?

704
00:47:56,956 --> 00:47:59,000
Even yourself?

705
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,836
Adapt or die.

706
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,966
This is about you and your shit,
isn't it?

707
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:10,136
Twenty years ago,
some scout got it wrong.

708
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:12,889
- Okay. Okay.
- Now you declare war on the system.

709
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:17,769
Okay, okay, my turn.
You don't have a crystal ball.

710
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,523
You can't look at a kid and predict
his future any more than I can.

711
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:23,983
I've sat at those kitchen tables
with you...

712
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,153
and listened to you tell parents,
"When I know, I know.

713
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,322
And when it comes to your son,
I know."

714
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,950
And you don't.

715
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,328
You don't.

716
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,291
Okay. I don't give a shit
about friendship...

717
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:43,002
this situation, or the past.

718
00:48:43,169 --> 00:48:46,798
Major League Baseball thinks
the way I think. You're not gonna win.

719
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,551
And I'll give you a nickel's worth
of free advice.

720
00:48:49,717 --> 00:48:52,011
You're never gonna
get another job...

721
00:48:52,178 --> 00:48:55,765
after this catastrophic season
you're about to set us all up for.

722
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,934
You'll have to explain to your kid...

723
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,645
why you're working
at Dick's Sporting Goods.

724
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,862
I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.

725
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,869
- Fuck you, Billy.
- Now I will.

726
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,624
Good luck, Art.

727
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,800
Kubota.
You never played ball, right?

728
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,803
- I played a little T-ball.
- You're the new head scout.

729
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,680
Congratulations.

730
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:46,441
So Boston's gonna wait and see?

731
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:49,402
Yeah.

732
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,239
- Yeah.
- It's just you and me, Pete.

733
00:49:53,406 --> 00:49:55,158
And we're all in.

734
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,956
<i>It sounds like you're apologizing
for what they're doing.</i>

735
00:50:02,123 --> 00:50:04,834
<i>I'm not. I just don't know
what you're gonna do...</i>

736
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:08,379
<i>with the budget that the A's have.</i>
<i>Who are you gonna get?</i>

737
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:10,715
<i>I'm looking
at the spring-training roster.</i>

738
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,592
<i>- You gotta be kidding me.
- How so?</i>

739
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,886
<i>- He looked like a clown out there.
- Who?</i>

740
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:18,640
<i>- Chad Bradford.
- Tell me about Bradford.</i>

741
00:50:18,806 --> 00:50:21,267
<i>I like him a little bit,
but he's a specialist.</i>

742
00:50:21,434 --> 00:50:24,479
<i>He's not a guy that you say,</i>
"<i>The eighth inning is yours...</i>

743
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,481
<i>lefties vs. righties.</i>"

744
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,316
<i>In my opinion.</i>

745
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,944
<i>I don't know what Billy Beane
and management...</i>

746
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,445
<i>understands about him.</i>

747
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,281
<i>He only throws the ball
about 82, 83 miles an hour.</i>

748
00:50:35,448 --> 00:50:38,868
<i>- There must be something...
- He is a freak, and not in a good way.</i>

749
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,456
<i>- Let me ask you this.
- Talking about trying to win a division.</i>

750
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,959
<i>We're counting on David
to be the guy he was.</i>

751
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:48,628
<i>I have my doubts. He's gotten old.</i>

752
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,298
<i>That's why he's not in New York
anymore, not in Cleveland anymore.</i>

753
00:50:52,465 --> 00:50:55,802
<i>We paid him the money we should've
been giving to Johnny Damon.</i>

754
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,053
<i>- Hey.
- Jeremy Giambi.</i>

755
00:50:58,429 --> 00:51:00,014
<i>That's the one to worry about.</i>

756
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:02,976
<i>He gets comps up and down Vegas
more than in Oakland.</i>

757
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:05,478
<i>That should tell you something
right there.</i>

758
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:09,232
<i>- Isn't that the deal with these guys?
- He has one good year.</i>

759
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:13,069
<i>And he gets a huge offer
and then he gets traded.</i>

760
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:18,575
- Bob. Harder.
- Hatteberg.

761
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,914
Good. Good.

762
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,001
<i>Billy, we have to talk
about Hatteberg.</i>

763
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:30,628
- Go.
- There's just no feel for the spot.

764
00:51:30,795 --> 00:51:34,340
I think it's a long shot that he can be
a big-league first baseman.

765
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:37,802
It's day one of the first week.
You can't judge this yet.

766
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,554
No, I think we can judge it.

767
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:44,017
I mean, I like him, you know,
but I can judge him.

768
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:45,810
First base is the moon to him.

769
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:49,856
It wasn't to Giambi. Giambi's the worst
first baseman in baseball.

770
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,526
- Gonna compare him to Giambi?
- What are we talking about?

771
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,986
All right.

772
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,281
What do you think, Wash?

773
00:51:58,823 --> 00:52:02,285
The nice way to say it
is he lacks confidence.

774
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,953
Well, give him some.

775
00:52:04,662 --> 00:52:07,248
I'll do that, but we got Peña,
who can play first.

776
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,834
And he's looking mighty good
out there.

777
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,712
We wanna go with Hattie.

778
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,302
We got six weeks.

779
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,387
Get down in it.

780
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:28,853
- There you go.
- Scotty H.

781
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,689
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Picking machine.

782
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:34,192
It's only baseball.

783
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,408
This better work.

784
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,662
I'm just kidding you.

785
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,969
<i>Let's go, Oakland!</i>

786
00:53:02,136 --> 00:53:04,430
<i>Let's go, Oakland!</i>

787
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:10,269
- What is wrong with this thing?
- It's a dollar, man.

788
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:12,855
- What?
- Welcome to Oakland, D.J.

789
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:15,066
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

790
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:19,070
I think this year, we're gonna show
that it takes a team to win...

791
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,406
not any individual guy,
just a team.

792
00:53:21,572 --> 00:53:24,951
And I think we got
a hell of a ball club here.

793
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,161
Chad, are you intimidated
at all today?

794
00:53:27,328 --> 00:53:32,542
I wouldn't say I'm intimidated, really.
I'm just really excited, like you said.

795
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,212
Jeremy, how's the team gonna fare
without your brother, Jason?

796
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,090
Well, you know,
the organization did a great job...

797
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,968
of bringing in good young guys
to fill that role.

798
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,554
Let's face it,
they're getting a deal with you.

799
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,973
The Yankees are paying Jason a lot
of money.

800
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,226
You are coming here on a dime.
How does that make you feel?

801
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,311
I feel good.

802
00:53:52,478 --> 00:53:55,481
- How are the nerves in your fingers?
- You know.

803
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:57,692
Gotta start with the age,
36 years old.

804
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,111
How do you think
your body's gonna hold up?

805
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:03,489
You spend a lot of time at strip clubs,
partying.

806
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:06,242
Do you resent the attention you get
off the field?

807
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,452
I love it.

808
00:54:07,618 --> 00:54:09,829
- You spend a lot of time in Vegas.
- I do.

809
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:14,208
- I feel great. I did a lot of work to get...
- Excuse me. Get out of my shot.

810
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,418
Sorry, go ahead.

811
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,712
There have been questions
about my age...

812
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,632
and my declining skills, some say,
but I'm here to prove that wrong.

813
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:23,509
I asked if you were 100 percent.

814
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,353
- Excuse me, Mr. Beane?
- Hey, Chad.

815
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,815
- Hey, I'm not disturbing you, am I?
- Not at all. What's up?

816
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:41,068
I wanted to say thank you
for this opportunity.

817
00:54:41,235 --> 00:54:44,697
Well, we enjoy having you.
It's gonna work out well for all of us.

818
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:48,785
I appreciate it, sir. Nobody's ever
given me a chance like this before.

819
00:54:49,368 --> 00:54:50,453
Nobody?

820
00:54:51,537 --> 00:54:53,623
Well, just you, sir.

821
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,543
Well, it's a big day,
one you won't forget.

822
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,879
Appreciate it.
And I wanna let you know...

823
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,882
I'm gonna be praying for you
and your family.

824
00:55:03,424 --> 00:55:05,218
No problem.

825
00:55:05,843 --> 00:55:09,430
Well, here we are just minutes away
from the season opener of 2002...

826
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,807
for the Oakland A's.

827
00:55:10,973 --> 00:55:12,683
The first pitch is moments away.

828
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,977
We'll come back
with the national anthem.

829
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:16,562
Opening day is upon us.

830
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,566
All right, fellas, smile. Here we go.

831
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,910
I'm going in.
Text me the play-by-play.

832
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,662
What? Why?

833
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:35,540
I don't watch the games.

834
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,675
Detail, halt!

835
00:55:47,051 --> 00:55:49,929
And forward face!

836
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:53,159
<i>That's the third Ranger batter
to be hit today.</i>

837
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:57,830
<i>Twice Alex Rodriguez was nicked.
The ninth...</i>

838
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:35,701
I should've made you a bigger part
of the conversation from day one.

839
00:57:35,868 --> 00:57:37,870
It'd be clear what we're trying to do.

840
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,998
That was my mistake, Art.
I take responsibility for that.

841
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:44,543
- What are you trying to say?
- Doesn't matter what moves I make...

842
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,713
if you don't play the team
the way they're designed to be.

843
00:57:49,548 --> 00:57:51,842
Billy, you're out of your depth.

844
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:56,055
- Why not Hatteberg at first?
- Because he can't play first.

845
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,641
- How do you know?
- Not my first baseball game.

846
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,519
- Scott Hatteberg can't hit.
- He gets on base.

847
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:05,064
Still keeps us in the plus column.
We need to be seven over .500.

848
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,816
What?

849
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,363
Anything else?

850
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,784
Yeah. I would've rather seen
Bradford in the end than Magnante.

851
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,452
Bradford's a righty.

852
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:21,747
- I don't care about righty-lefty.
- I do.

853
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:29,505
- Could this be about your contract?
- No.

854
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:34,051
This is about you doing your job
and me doing mine.

855
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:35,761
Mine's me being left alone...

856
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:38,848
to manage this team
you assembled for me.

857
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,601
- I didn't assemble them for you, Art.
- No shit.

858
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,445
Good meeting.

859
00:58:52,611 --> 00:58:53,738
Every time we talk...

860
00:58:53,904 --> 00:58:56,699
I'm reinvigorated
by my love of the game.

861
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,476
<i>We got Grady Fuson, former head
of scouting with the Athletics.</i>

862
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:26,437
<i>And, Grady, can you interpret for us
what's going on?</i>

863
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,773
<i>- They call it Moneyball.
- Moneyball?</i>

864
00:59:28,939 --> 00:59:33,486
<i>Yes, and it was a nice theory,
and now it's just not working out.</i>

865
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:37,656
<i>Billy Beane has built this team
on the ideas of a guy, Bill James...</i>

866
00:59:37,823 --> 00:59:42,495
<i>who wrote an interesting book
on baseball statistics.</i>

867
00:59:42,661 --> 00:59:46,665
<i>The problem is that Bill James
never played, never managed.</i>

868
00:59:46,832 --> 00:59:50,169
<i>He was in fact a security guard
at a pork-and-beans company.</i>

869
00:59:51,545 --> 00:59:54,256
<i>Do you see this as a decimation
of the organization?</i>

870
00:59:54,423 --> 00:59:56,926
- <i>He bought a ticket on the</i> Titanic.
<i>- Oh, boy.</i>

871
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,345
<i>He's tried to come up
with a new approach.</i>

872
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,765
<i>My hat's</i> off <i>to him. It won't work.</i>

873
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:06,560
<i>One-two pitch. Tejada strikes out.</i>

874
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:07,895
<i>And that is the game.</i>

875
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:11,148
<i>The Seattle Mariners
win both games on this series, Ray.</i>

876
01:00:11,315 --> 01:00:14,860
<i>They've won 10 in a row.
Seattle is 13 and 3.</i>

877
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,865
I can't watch this shit.

878
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:22,535
Go on the road with the team.

879
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:24,912
You don't go on the road
with the team.

880
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,707
- That's why I want you to do it.
- Why don't you?

881
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:33,045
I can't develop personal relationships
with these guys.

882
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:37,758
I gotta be able to trade them,
send them down, sometimes cut them.

883
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,888
Which is something
you should learn to do, by the way.

884
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,644
I would never have to cut a player,
unless you...

885
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,398
- Oh, come on.
- "Come on" what?

886
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:55,067
- Let's practice.
- No.

887
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,112
Yeah. I'm a player.
You gotta cut me from the roster.

888
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,321
- No.
- Go.

889
01:00:59,488 --> 01:01:00,948
- What do you mean, no?
- No.

890
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,741
- Do it.
- This is stupid.

891
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,327
Part of the job, man.

892
01:01:09,748 --> 01:01:11,250
Fine.

893
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:16,046
Billy, please have a seat.
I need to talk to you for a minute.

894
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:17,756
Go on.

895
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:21,177
You've been a huge part
of this team.

896
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:24,138
But sometimes you have to
make decisions for the team.

897
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,931
I'm sure you can understand.

898
01:01:26,098 --> 01:01:29,101
- You're cutting me?
- I'm really sorry.

899
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:31,437
I just bought a house here.

900
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,272
- Well...
- In Oakland.

901
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,611
Well... Well...

902
01:01:38,777 --> 01:01:42,031
"Well... Well..."?
That's all you got to say?

903
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,575
My kid just started a new school.

904
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:48,078
- They made friends.
- That's...

905
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:51,457
You shouldn't pull them out
in the middle of the year.

906
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,460
- You should wait.
- What the hell are you talking about?

907
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,462
I don't know. I shouldn't have...

908
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:59,131
I'm not gonna do this.
I think this is stupid.

909
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,468
I'm not gonna fire anybody,
and this is dumb.

910
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:06,805
They're professional ballplayers.
Just be straight with them.

911
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:08,933
No fluff, just facts.

912
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:13,938
Pete, I gotta let you go.
Jack's office will handle the details.

913
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,192
That's it?

914
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:20,319
Really?

915
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:24,907
You rather get a bullet to the head or
five to the chest and bleed to death?

916
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,161
Are those my only two options?

917
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,497
Go on the road with the team.

918
01:02:34,124 --> 01:02:35,751
Okay.

919
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,637
Say, bro.

920
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,847
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.

921
01:02:49,014 --> 01:02:51,850
How come your boss doesn't travel
with the team?

922
01:02:53,727 --> 01:02:57,314
He doesn't like to mingle
with the players.

923
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,694
Is that supposed to make us
easier to cut?

924
01:03:06,907 --> 01:03:09,034
I don't know. I don't know.

925
01:03:09,201 --> 01:03:14,039
And how come soda
is a dollar in the clubhouse?

926
01:03:14,206 --> 01:03:16,458
I never seen nothing like that.

927
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,546
Billy likes to keep the money
on the field.

928
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,589
Soda money?

929
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:24,591
Really?

930
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:28,512
Where on the field
is the dollar I'm paying for soda?

931
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:33,559
It's hard to see exactly...

932
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,687
- but it's there, yeah.
- Yeah, it is hard to see.

933
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,897
I'm done.

934
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,786
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

935
01:03:52,953 --> 01:03:54,955
- How are you?
- I'm good.

936
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,249
- Was it bumpy?
- It was okay.

937
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,379
<i>So with this loss tonight,
the Oakland Athletics...</i>

938
01:04:02,546 --> 01:04:05,716
<i>incredibly, have lost 14
of their last 17 games.</i>

939
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:10,888
<i>They are 10 games back
in the American League West.</i>

940
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,557
<i>Is it fair to say
the experiment has failed?</i>

941
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,060
<i>Well, absolutely. It was predictable.</i>

942
01:04:16,226 --> 01:04:19,188
<i>You don't wish anybody
a lack of success...</i>

943
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,775
<i>- but the facts are in front of you.
- You can't blame Art Howe.</i>

944
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:24,985
<i>- No.
- The fact of the matter is...</i>

945
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:28,197
<i>this is not about statistics,
this is about people.</i>

946
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,116
<i>Art Howe is not the problem.</i>

947
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:33,952
<i>The problem
is in the general manager's office...</i>

948
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:35,204
<i>with Billy Beane.</i>

949
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,956
<i>The root of the problem for me
is philosophical.</i>

950
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:40,376
<i>I said it before.
This is fantasy baseball.</i>

951
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:42,336
<i>Billy is just not thinking.</i>

952
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,130
<i>Start thinking about a new GM,
making changes.</i>

953
01:04:45,297 --> 01:04:46,715
<i>He never goes to the games.</i>

954
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:51,303
<i>- This was very predictable.
- He needs to look at what's going on.</i>

955
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,932
<i>- The man needs to get real.
- I want Billy Beane gone.</i>

956
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,559
<i>Calling for Beane's head.
I want your thoughts.</i>

957
01:04:57,726 --> 01:05:02,940
<i>The past 18 games, they've been
shut out or scored one run four times.</i>

958
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,817
<i>They're just not scoring enough.</i>

959
01:05:04,983 --> 01:05:08,153
<i>It's not just the offense,
not Thad Bosley and the hitters.</i>

960
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,616
<i>It's everything. if there was one thing
you could pick out, you'd try to fix it...</i>

961
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:18,122
<i>but just everything is in a funk
right now.</i>

962
01:05:22,709 --> 01:05:25,295
What the hell am I doing?

963
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:30,426
Oh, man.

964
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:32,594
Look, Steve.

965
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,267
I believe in what we're doing.

966
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,311
The record doesn't reflect the strength
of this team...

967
01:05:41,478 --> 01:05:44,189
or where we're gonna be
at the end of the season.

968
01:05:44,356 --> 01:05:48,986
Now, Pete and I here feel very strongly
that we stay on the track we've chosen.

969
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,697
Our sample size has been too small.
It's too...

970
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,532
Early. It's still early.

971
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:57,286
Where do we expect to be
by the All-Star break?

972
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,956
Our goal and our expectation...

973
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,877
is by mid-July
to be within seven games of first.

974
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:06,503
That would be this working.

975
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,173
- That keeps us in the hunt.
- Exceptionally well.

976
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:12,593
- By July.
- July.

977
01:06:12,759 --> 01:06:16,638
And what's gonna prevent you
from accomplishing that?

978
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:18,474
What are you afraid of?

979
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,560
Nothing.
That's why we're here, Steve.

980
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:25,063
That's why we get up in the morning.
That's all we do.

981
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,168
- More?
- Yeah, a little more.

982
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,796
- Don't tell your mother.
- I won't.

983
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:52,674
- Chocolate sauce?
- Yes.

984
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,927
Stop.

985
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,474
- Big spoon or little spoon?
- Little spoon.

986
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,519
Thank you.

987
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,323
Dad, there's no way
you're gonna lose your job, right?

988
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,950
What?

989
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:22,162
- Well, I don't know. I'm just wondering.
- Where'd you hear that?

990
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,289
Well, I go on the Internet sometimes.

991
01:07:24,456 --> 01:07:27,626
Well, don't do that.
Don't go on the Internet.

992
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,629
Or watch TV or read newspapers...

993
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:33,340
or talk to people.

994
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,176
I don't talk to people.
I just read stuff.

995
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,971
Honey, everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

996
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:41,598
Really, you don't have to worry.

997
01:07:41,765 --> 01:07:45,143
But if you lose your job,
will you have to move away?

998
01:07:45,894 --> 01:07:48,313
Honey, I'm not gonna lose my job.

999
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:51,733
You don't have to worry.

1000
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,488
- Okay.
- Hey.

1001
01:07:57,072 --> 01:08:00,450
- There's no problem.
- Okay.

1002
01:08:00,617 --> 01:08:03,954
All right? I got uptown problems,
which are not problems at all.

1003
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,331
You're not worried, right?

1004
01:08:06,498 --> 01:08:09,001
- No, I'm not worried.
- Okay.

1005
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,968
Peña.

1006
01:08:20,637 --> 01:08:22,264
Okay.

1007
01:08:35,068 --> 01:08:37,195
I want Dye in right...

1008
01:08:37,362 --> 01:08:40,198
Justice DH-ing,
Peña on the bench...

1009
01:08:40,365 --> 01:08:42,159
Hatteberg at first...

1010
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,370
and anyone but Mags
first out of the pen.

1011
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:47,456
You want Peña on the bench?

1012
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,751
That's right. So you can play Hattie.

1013
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:53,170
Peña is not only
the best first baseman...

1014
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,505
he's the only first baseman.

1015
01:08:55,672 --> 01:08:58,050
Hattie gets on base more than Peña.

1016
01:08:58,216 --> 01:09:00,719
- In fact, 20 percent more.
- And his fielding?

1017
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,555
His fielding does not matter.

1018
01:09:04,556 --> 01:09:06,808
- I've heard enough of this.
- Have you?

1019
01:09:06,975 --> 01:09:08,560
And I...

1020
01:09:09,394 --> 01:09:12,397
I disagree with you,
plain and simple.

1021
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,484
And moreover,
I'm playing my team...

1022
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:19,655
in a way that I can explain
in job interviews next winter.

1023
01:09:20,572 --> 01:09:22,240
Okay?

1024
01:09:27,245 --> 01:09:30,248
Hattie. Not Peña.

1025
01:09:34,586 --> 01:09:35,962
What's up, skip?

1026
01:09:36,129 --> 01:09:38,590
- How you doing?
- Good, how you doing, man?

1027
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,384
Get some sleep last night?

1028
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,597
<i>As the A's hit the field,</i>
<i>we are ready for baseball.</i>

1029
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:49,101
<i>First one out of the dugout
is rookie sensation Carlos Peña...</i>

1030
01:09:49,267 --> 01:09:54,231
<i>one of the few bright lights in this
lineup, taking his spot at first base.</i>

1031
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:37,566
Billy, quick question. Do you expect
these guys to produce more or...?

1032
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:40,026
- Not now.
- What's the reason for the slump?

1033
01:10:58,336 --> 01:10:59,880
Get down.

1034
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:06,011
Is losing fun?

1035
01:11:09,222 --> 01:11:12,350
- Is losing fun?
- No.

1036
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,690
What are you having fun for?

1037
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:46,510
That's what losing sounds like.

1038
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,484
Are you okay, Dad?

1039
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,195
- You're doing it again.
- What?

1040
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:07,656
You're worrying about me.

1041
01:12:07,864 --> 01:12:09,699
You're in last place, Dad.

1042
01:12:09,866 --> 01:12:12,244
- Do I look worried?
- Yeah.

1043
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:16,373
Because you're getting on an airplane,
and those things crash all the time.

1044
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,959
Please stop worrying
about your dad.

1045
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:22,879
- We're all set.
- Okay.

1046
01:12:24,756 --> 01:12:26,925
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1047
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:30,262
All right. Your dad's not in trouble.

1048
01:12:31,304 --> 01:12:33,265
Okay.

1049
01:13:12,178 --> 01:13:13,972
Yeah.

1050
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:22,147
- Suzanne, get me Ed Wade.
- Okay.

1051
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:24,024
- Coffee on?
- Yes.

1052
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:26,818
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Billy.

1053
01:13:30,405 --> 01:13:32,240
Oh, hi, Louisa.

1054
01:13:32,407 --> 01:13:35,327
- I need Ed Wade for Billy Beane.
- Hi.

1055
01:13:36,494 --> 01:13:37,537
Please hold.

1056
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:40,332
- What's up?
- Wade's on 2.

1057
01:13:40,498 --> 01:13:41,958
- Ed?
<i>- Hello?</i>

1058
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:44,544
- Ed, it's Billy.
<i>- Billy, what's up?</i>

1059
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:47,714
- Look, I need a little help on defense.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1060
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:50,467
I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi
for it.

1061
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:52,636
<i>- Really?</i>
- What?

1062
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:54,930
- Who you got?
- What?

1063
01:13:55,096 --> 01:13:58,266
- <i>Well, let me think.</i>
- What are you doing?

1064
01:13:58,433 --> 01:13:59,684
Cleaning house.

1065
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:01,811
<i>- Mabry?</i>
- Maybe what?

1066
01:14:01,978 --> 01:14:05,023
- <i>No, Mabry.</i>
- Hold on.

1067
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,025
- No.
- Why not?

1068
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:09,361
Because you can't trade
Jeremy Giambi.

1069
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,113
He'll be fine, Ed.

1070
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,866
<i>Why do I get the feeling
you're picking my pocket?</i>

1071
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:18,370
I'm not. You're picking mine.
Giambi's name alone is worth more.

1072
01:14:18,536 --> 01:14:20,747
<i>- What's wrong with him?</i>
- Nothing.

1073
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:24,417
Can we say it's done in theory
and start drawing up the paperwork?

1074
01:14:24,584 --> 01:14:26,836
- <i>Okay, but you're gonna have-</i>-
- Great.

1075
01:14:27,003 --> 01:14:28,713
He was gonna say something else.

1076
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,466
When you get the answer
you're looking for, hang up.

1077
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:32,676
- Suzanne.
- Yes?

1078
01:14:32,842 --> 01:14:35,303
- David Dombrowski.
- Okay.

1079
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,431
- And Peña's going too.
- I don't think you should do that.

1080
01:14:38,598 --> 01:14:43,061
- I really don't think you should do that.
- I want Hatteberg in the lineup tonight.

1081
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,604
You need to take a minute.

1082
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:47,899
I think you seriously need to think
about what you're doing.

1083
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,568
- Because you're upset.
- Okay.

1084
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,904
What am I missing?

1085
01:14:53,571 --> 01:14:55,907
These are hard moves
to explain to people.

1086
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,410
Why is that a problem, Pete?

1087
01:15:01,204 --> 01:15:03,415
Don't make
an emotional decision, Billy.

1088
01:15:03,581 --> 01:15:07,961
- David Dombrowski's on 3.
- Look, we're gonna shake things up.

1089
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:11,172
Dave. Peña's going on the block.
You're my first call.

1090
01:15:12,173 --> 01:15:14,968
Because he's making the rest
of the team look bad.

1091
01:15:15,927 --> 01:15:17,762
He's gonna be a Rookie of the Year.

1092
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:21,099
- Probably an All-Star.
- He's an All-Star, Dave.

1093
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:24,769
No. I want a reliever and cash.

1094
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,940
Okay. You got five minutes, Dave.
I'm not waiting.

1095
01:15:29,649 --> 01:15:33,445
Billy, Peña is an All-Star, okay?

1096
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:37,657
And if you dump him and this
Hatteberg thing doesn't work out...

1097
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:39,534
you know this is...

1098
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,787
This is the kind of decision
that gets you fired.

1099
01:15:42,954 --> 01:15:44,539
It is.

1100
01:15:45,081 --> 01:15:47,125
Yes, you're right.

1101
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:49,878
I may lose my job.

1102
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:53,465
In which case I'm a 44-year-old guy
with a high school diploma...

1103
01:15:53,631 --> 01:15:56,926
and a daughter
I'd like to be able to send to college.

1104
01:15:57,427 --> 01:16:00,472
You're 25 years old,
with a degree from Yale...

1105
01:16:00,638 --> 01:16:03,224
and a pretty impressive
apprenticeship.

1106
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,811
I don't think
we're asking the right question.

1107
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:10,315
I think the question
we should be asking is...

1108
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,151
do you believe in this thing or not?

1109
01:16:14,986 --> 01:16:16,571
I do.

1110
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:22,660
It's a problem you think
we need to explain ourselves.

1111
01:16:22,827 --> 01:16:26,039
Don't. To anyone.

1112
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:30,877
Okay.

1113
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:36,883
Now, I'm gonna see this thing through,
for better or worse.

1114
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:45,183
Just tell me, do you project we'll win
more with Hatteberg or Peña at first?

1115
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,186
It's close...

1116
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,439
but theoretically, Hatteberg.

1117
01:16:52,315 --> 01:16:57,320
- What are we talking about, then?
- Dombrowski's on again, on 3.

1118
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:01,074
Yeah?

1119
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,701
Okay, that'll work.

1120
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:06,621
Great. I need one more thing.

1121
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:10,041
Soda. Yeah, I don't want my guys
paying for soda.

1122
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:12,877
I want you to stock my machine
for three years.

1123
01:17:13,044 --> 01:17:14,546
I'm serious.

1124
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:17,549
Great. It's a deal.

1125
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:20,635
Go tell Peña he's gotta pack.

1126
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:25,348
- You want me to tell Peña?
- Part of the job.

1127
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:30,270
What about Giambi?
You want me to tell him too?

1128
01:17:30,436 --> 01:17:32,397
I'll tell him.

1129
01:17:39,362 --> 01:17:40,947
- Excuse me, Carlos?
- Yeah?

1130
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:43,074
- Can I speak with you a minute?
- Yeah.

1131
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,419
Carlos, you've been traded
to the Tigers.

1132
01:17:57,922 --> 01:17:59,924
This is Jay Palmer's number.

1133
01:18:00,091 --> 01:18:02,635
He's the traveling secretary
for the team.

1134
01:18:02,802 --> 01:18:05,847
He's expecting your call.
He'll take care of everything.

1135
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:17,609
- Is that it?
- Yes.

1136
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:26,326
Okay.

1137
01:18:38,671 --> 01:18:40,131
Okay.

1138
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:43,927
Art, you got a minute?

1139
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,225
Yeah. Take a seat.

1140
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:57,982
You can't start Peña at first tonight.
You'll have to start Hatteberg.

1141
01:18:58,816 --> 01:19:03,821
I don't wanna go 15 rounds, Billy.
The lineup card is mine, and that's all.

1142
01:19:03,988 --> 01:19:05,990
That lineup card is definitely yours.

1143
01:19:06,157 --> 01:19:08,743
I'm just saying you can't start Peña
at first.

1144
01:19:11,829 --> 01:19:13,998
Well, I am starting him at first.

1145
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:18,127
I don't think so.
He plays for Detroit now.

1146
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:24,217
You traded Peña?

1147
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:26,928
Yeah.

1148
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:31,516
And Menechino, Hiljus, Tam
are all being sent down.

1149
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:35,979
- You are outside your mind.
- Yeah. Cuckoo.

1150
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:40,566
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, Jeremy, grab a seat.

1151
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:46,656
Jeremy, you've been traded
to the Phillies.

1152
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:49,450
This is Ed Wade's number.
He's a good guy, the GM.

1153
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:51,953
He's expecting your call.

1154
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,956
Buddy will help you
with the plane flight.

1155
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,002
You're a good ballplayer, Jeremy...

1156
01:19:59,168 --> 01:20:01,713
and we wish you the best.

1157
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:20,315
Jeremy's gone too.

1158
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,402
You're killing this team.

1159
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:28,239
Art, I can do this all day long.

1160
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:35,747
Hey.

1161
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:38,750
You agree with this?

1162
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,836
Hundred percent.

1163
01:20:43,379 --> 01:20:44,922
You want this door closed?

1164
01:20:57,477 --> 01:20:59,937
- Scotty H.
- Sir?

1165
01:21:00,938 --> 01:21:04,609
- Go field some grounders.
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,611
Everybody, listen up.

1167
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:12,367
You may not look
like a winning team...

1168
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,705
but you are one.

1169
01:21:25,004 --> 01:21:27,048
So play like one tonight.

1170
01:21:35,681 --> 01:21:37,892
Oh, shit.

1171
01:21:40,978 --> 01:21:44,148
When you're getting your pitch,
you're hitting .625, massive.

1172
01:21:44,315 --> 01:21:46,150
You're crushing the ball.

1173
01:21:46,317 --> 01:21:49,195
But when you swing at things...
Your pitch is middle-in.

1174
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:52,240
When you're swinging low and away,
you're batting. 158.

1175
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,492
Every at bat's
like a hand of blackjack.

1176
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,994
Every card that's dealt,
your odds change.

1177
01:21:57,161 --> 01:22:01,499
So every first-pitch strike, your batting
average goes down about 75 points.

1178
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:02,834
Seventy-five points.

1179
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,253
He should throw 100 pitches
before the fifth.

1180
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,171
You wanna knock that starter out.

1181
01:22:07,338 --> 01:22:10,842
I want you taking at bats off the 10th
and 11 Th pitcher by the end.

1182
01:22:11,008 --> 01:22:13,428
This is your basic breakdown
of the pitches...

1183
01:22:13,594 --> 01:22:15,805
where you should be hitting them,
why.

1184
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:19,517
- So you want us to walk more?
- Good question. Yes.

1185
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:23,020
Mr. Justice.

1186
01:22:23,187 --> 01:22:25,148
- Had a few thoughts.
- Yeah?

1187
01:22:25,314 --> 01:22:27,692
- Yeah.
- Gonna teach me some things?

1188
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:29,861
Excuse me?

1189
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:33,698
Never seen a GM talk to players
like that.

1190
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:36,534
You never seen a GM
who was a player.

1191
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:45,626
- We got a problem, David?
- No, it's okay.

1192
01:22:45,793 --> 01:22:48,004
I know your routine.

1193
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:51,424
It's patter. It's for effect.

1194
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:56,888
But it's for them, all right?
That shit ain't for me.

1195
01:22:57,388 --> 01:22:59,140
Oh, you're special?

1196
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:06,189
You're paying me 7 million bucks
a year, man, so, yeah...

1197
01:23:06,355 --> 01:23:08,691
maybe I am, a little bit.

1198
01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:11,819
No, man, I ain't paying you 7.

1199
01:23:12,528 --> 01:23:14,405
Yankees are paying half your salary.

1200
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:17,408
That's what the New York Yankees
think of you.

1201
01:23:18,242 --> 01:23:22,580
They're paying you $3.5 million
to play against them.

1202
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:26,042
Where you going with this, Billy?

1203
01:23:26,834 --> 01:23:29,170
David, you're 37.

1204
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:33,090
How about you and I be honest about
what each of us want out of this?

1205
01:23:34,717 --> 01:23:38,095
I wanna milk the last ounce of baseball
you got in you.

1206
01:23:38,262 --> 01:23:40,556
And you wanna stay in the show.

1207
01:23:41,098 --> 01:23:43,059
Let's do that.

1208
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:46,521
I'm not paying you
for the player you used to be.

1209
01:23:46,687 --> 01:23:49,690
I'm paying you for the player you are
right now.

1210
01:23:49,857 --> 01:23:53,277
You're smart.
You get what we're trying to do here.

1211
01:23:53,444 --> 01:23:56,280
Make an example
for the younger guys.

1212
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:58,241
Be a leader.

1213
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:00,576
Can you do that?

1214
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:10,628
All right. I got you.

1215
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:14,799
We're cool?

1216
01:24:16,884 --> 01:24:18,344
We're cool.

1217
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:24,850
Scotty H.

1218
01:24:25,017 --> 01:24:27,853
- Yo, what's up, D.J.?
- Picking machine.

1219
01:24:28,312 --> 01:24:30,731
How you liking first base, man?

1220
01:24:32,024 --> 01:24:35,236
It's coming along. Picking it up.

1221
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:39,532
You know, tough transition,
but I'm starting to feel better with it.

1222
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:41,742
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1223
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:43,828
What's your biggest fear?

1224
01:24:44,453 --> 01:24:47,164
A baseball being hit
in my general direction.

1225
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,378
That's funny. Seriously, what is it?

1226
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,175
No, seriously, that is.

1227
01:25:08,936 --> 01:25:11,272
Well, hey, good luck with that.

1228
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,608
Be social out there.

1229
01:25:14,525 --> 01:25:17,069
- Social.
- Social. Like a greeter at the Gap.

1230
01:25:17,236 --> 01:25:19,322
Guy steps into your office,
chat him up.

1231
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:22,158
You're well-read.
You went to school.

1232
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:24,493
- Yeah.
- Have some fun. Relax.

1233
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:27,538
Everyone wants to attack.
Quit trying to attack.

1234
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:30,958
Let the game come to you, man.
There's no clock on this thing.

1235
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:32,543
This is a war of attrition.

1236
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:37,131
If I take more, I could even take
a few strikes, but I'll get walked more.

1237
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:41,052
You get on base, we win.
You don't, we lose.

1238
01:25:41,218 --> 01:25:44,555
And I hate losing, Chavvie. I hate it.

1239
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:47,308
I hate losing
more than I even wanna win.

1240
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:48,809
And there's a difference.

1241
01:25:48,976 --> 01:25:50,478
- No bunts.
- Bunts is an out.

1242
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,898
- Even if the third baseman is back?
- No bunting whatsoever.

1243
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:56,817
If someone bunts on us,
throw it to first.

1244
01:25:56,984 --> 01:25:58,736
Don't be a hero and go to second.

1245
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,321
Let them make the mistakes.

1246
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:03,407
When your enemy's making mistakes,
don't interrupt them.

1247
01:26:03,574 --> 01:26:06,118
They're giving you an out.
Just giving it to you.

1248
01:26:06,285 --> 01:26:07,578
Take it. Say thank you.

1249
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:09,747
Another thing. No more stealing.

1250
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:11,957
That's what I do,
what you pay me to do.

1251
01:26:12,124 --> 01:26:15,086
I pay you to get on first,
not get thrown out at second.

1252
01:26:15,252 --> 01:26:20,216
This is a process.
It's a process, it's a process. Okay?

1253
01:26:32,561 --> 01:26:36,440
<i>Jason takes it, goes to second
for the only out, and the A's get a run.</i>

1254
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:42,154
<i>Jermaine Dye homers again,
his second in two games.</i>

1255
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:46,784
<i>And the A's are still hanging in.</i>
<i>We'll get you scores here.</i>

1256
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:51,414
<i>The A's pull within two
of the Angels for the wild-card chase.</i>

1257
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,749
<i>The Reds have now dropped
five in a row...</i>

1258
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:57,294
<i>as Oakland beats them
in the beginning of this series 5 to 3.</i>

1259
01:26:57,461 --> 01:26:58,796
<i>Tejada walks.</i>

1260
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:00,297
<i>Ball four.</i>

1261
01:27:00,464 --> 01:27:03,342
<i>Ball four and Hatteberg walks.</i>

1262
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:08,389
<i>What is happening in Oakland?
The A's have won seven in a row.</i>

1263
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,808
<i>A lot of excitement.
What a winning streak.</i>

1264
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:13,811
<i>But how about the calming influence
of Art Howe?</i>

1265
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:17,606
When you say "your source,"
if it's not me or Peter, they don't know.

1266
01:27:17,773 --> 01:27:19,483
<i>He's managing
an unorthodox team.</i>

1267
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:21,444
- Right.
<i>- It's not a perfect roster.</i>

1268
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:24,905
<i>But right now, Art Howe is the reason
this team is winning.</i>

1269
01:27:25,072 --> 01:27:27,658
- <i>He deserves the credit.</i>
- Great, thanks. Bye.

1270
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:29,368
Did you hear that?

1271
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:32,496
I heard "seven in a row."
You get the Cleveland matchups?

1272
01:27:32,663 --> 01:27:34,582
Yeah, right here.

1273
01:27:42,339 --> 01:27:43,799
- Voos.
- Billy.

1274
01:27:43,966 --> 01:27:47,219
- That smell is getting worse.
- I'm on it.

1275
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:50,139
- What are we doing?
- Splitting it in half?

1276
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:52,141
- Both sides of the plate.
- Got it.

1277
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:55,019
- Huddy. Mix it up.
- Yes, sir.

1278
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:57,354
- Trust your slider, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

1279
01:27:57,521 --> 01:27:59,523
You guys quit distracting him.

1280
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:02,401
You couldn't hit that shit last night
with a paddle.

1281
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:04,403
You gotta see more pitches.

1282
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:07,072
- All right, Billy.
- Patience.

1283
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:12,495
- Hey, David.
- Hey, Billy.

1284
01:28:12,661 --> 01:28:14,038
- Great at bats.
- Thank you.

1285
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:15,748
- Really quality.
- Thank you.

1286
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:18,626
<i>Base hit to right field.
Tejada scores.</i>

1287
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:21,670
<i>Chavez coming in.
The ball gets past Guiel.</i>

1288
01:28:22,588 --> 01:28:26,717
<i>The A's, from 5-nothing down,
now lead 6 to 5.</i>

1289
01:28:36,727 --> 01:28:39,730
<i>The Oakland A's are completely
out of hand at the moment.</i>

1290
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,566
<i>They are an AL-best 17 and 4
this month.</i>

1291
01:28:42,733 --> 01:28:46,529
<i>They also took back-to-back series
at Boston and at New York.</i>

1292
01:28:46,695 --> 01:28:49,323
<i>Remember when they traded
Jeremy Giambi in June...</i>

1293
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,826
<i>and everyone thought
they’d just given up?</i>

1294
01:28:51,992 --> 01:28:54,662
<i>Actually, not so much.</i>

1295
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:01,252
<i>Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.</i>

1296
01:29:01,752 --> 01:29:04,922
- You thinking Rincon?
- His season's done. He's lost faith.

1297
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:08,092
- I think he's gonna dump him.
- Hard-core.

1298
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:10,553
Shapiro on 2.

1299
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:13,889
Mark, Billy. Let's be honest.

1300
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:17,434
A premier setup man isn't
gonna get you closer to the play-offs.

1301
01:29:17,601 --> 01:29:21,689
<i>- Are you referring to Rincon?</i>
- He's a luxury you can't afford, man.

1302
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:24,567
<i>And you can?
There's half a million on his contract.</i>

1303
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:26,777
<i>And we've got
at least one other suitor.</i>

1304
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:29,655
By "at least one," you mean one.

1305
01:29:29,822 --> 01:29:32,283
- Who is it?
<i>- I'd rather not say.</i>

1306
01:29:32,449 --> 01:29:34,785
- San Francisco.
- San Francisco.

1307
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:36,453
I'll call you back.

1308
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,416
What do you think we can get
for Magnante?

1309
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:41,834
Nothing.

1310
01:29:42,751 --> 01:29:45,796
- What's left on Venafro's contract?
- Two seventy-five.

1311
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:48,424
Suzanne,
get me Sabean on the line.

1312
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:52,678
Get the Giants interested in Venafro,
Mark's only got one buyer for Rincon.

1313
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:54,305
- Us.
- On 3.

1314
01:29:56,348 --> 01:29:59,810
Saby-Sabster, it's Billy.
What do you think of Venafro?

1315
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:02,146
I can let you have him
for almost nothing.

1316
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:04,899
<i>- Why would you do that?</i>
- Because I'm amazing.

1317
01:30:05,065 --> 01:30:07,067
I want a couple bucks
and a sweetener.

1318
01:30:07,484 --> 01:30:09,320
Throw in, say...

1319
01:30:09,486 --> 01:30:11,655
- Anderson.
- Anderson.

1320
01:30:11,822 --> 01:30:14,783
- <i>I like Anderson.</i>
- No, you don't. Nobody likes him.

1321
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:17,494
I don't know why I'm doing this.
But let's do it.

1322
01:30:17,661 --> 01:30:20,581
Venafro for Michaelson. Anderson.
I don't know his name.

1323
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:23,626
- <i>I'll think about it.</i>
- Think about it and call me back.

1324
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:26,170
Get Shapiro on.

1325
01:30:34,094 --> 01:30:36,347
Shapiro's on 2.

1326
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:40,351
- Mark.
- <i>You can't afford him, Billy.</i>

1327
01:30:40,517 --> 01:30:41,602
You sure about that?

1328
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,980
I get the impression
the market for Rincon is softening.

1329
01:30:45,147 --> 01:30:47,942
I could be wrong,
but I'd call whoever's interested...

1330
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:51,612
and see if they're still interested.
Call me back.

1331
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:55,866
- What about the Mets for Venafro?
- You offered him to the Giants.

1332
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:57,701
Suzanne, Steve Phillips.

1333
01:30:57,868 --> 01:31:02,706
Between Bonds, Kent, Nen, Snow,
San Francisco's never gonna do it.

1334
01:31:03,123 --> 01:31:06,877
- Totally agree.
- We just need them to cool on Rincon.

1335
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:10,172
- Phillips on 2.
- Steve-o, it's Billy.

1336
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:14,051
I hear you're looking for a reliever.
I can give you Venafro.

1337
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:16,720
- I can make it quick and easy.
<i>- What's the angle?</i>

1338
01:31:16,887 --> 01:31:19,890
- No angle.
<i>- Who am I getting fleeced for?</i>

1339
01:31:20,557 --> 01:31:23,936
- Hang on a sec.
- Bennett, maybe?

1340
01:31:24,103 --> 01:31:25,479
- How old?
- Twenty-six.

1341
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:27,731
Twenty-six, Double-A? Forget it.

1342
01:31:27,898 --> 01:31:29,984
Duncan, no.

1343
01:31:31,777 --> 01:31:33,529
No. Furbush, no.

1344
01:31:36,198 --> 01:31:39,910
Eckerton? Eckerton? Eckerton.

1345
01:31:41,036 --> 01:31:42,997
- Eckerton.
<i>- Eckerton? I like Eckerton.</i>

1346
01:31:43,163 --> 01:31:46,417
- You don't even know who Eckerton is.
<i>- ls Venafro hurt?</i>

1347
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:49,920
No, he's fine, he's fine.
It's just an issue for us.

1348
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:52,756
- <i>Last couple times, he got hammered.</i>
- Not his fault.

1349
01:31:52,923 --> 01:31:55,092
- That was us. We misused him.
- It's Steve.

1350
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:57,261
- I'm almost done.
- Steve Schott.

1351
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:00,639
Look, Steve-o,
let me be straight with you.

1352
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:03,600
Here's the deal.
I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal.

1353
01:32:03,767 --> 01:32:06,854
- <i>I heard the Giants-</i>-
- Giants want Venafro for Michaelson.

1354
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:08,939
- Anderson.
- I'd rather deal with you.

1355
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:12,109
You can give me Eckerton
and $225,000 in cash...

1356
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:14,319
and the Giants can't.

1357
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:17,197
- <i>I'll think about it.</i>
- Think about it.

1358
01:32:17,364 --> 01:32:19,742
But whoever calls me back first
gets Venafro.

1359
01:32:22,161 --> 01:32:23,370
Schott hung up.

1360
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:28,125
Oh, I want this one.

1361
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,469
Why isn't anybody calling?

1362
01:32:41,263 --> 01:32:43,474
Shapiro's on 2.

1363
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,268
Yeah?

1364
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:53,067
Okay, let me talk to my owner.
I'll call you back.

1365
01:32:53,233 --> 01:32:55,944
- Get Steve on the phone.
- Schott or Phillips?

1366
01:32:56,111 --> 01:32:58,989
Why would we call Phillips?
Phillips has gotta call us.

1367
01:33:02,826 --> 01:33:04,578
Tell him I'm on the other line.

1368
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:12,002
Hi, Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand.
I apologize for putting you on hold.

1369
01:33:12,169 --> 01:33:16,965
- Billy asked me to call you back.
- Tell him we want 225,000 for Rincon.

1370
01:33:17,132 --> 01:33:22,179
Billy says he needs $225,000
for Ricardo Rincon.

1371
01:33:22,721 --> 01:33:24,348
Please.

1372
01:33:25,849 --> 01:33:29,144
Yes, I added the "please" at the end.

1373
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,774
Okay. Let me...
Hold on one second, please.

1374
01:33:34,566 --> 01:33:36,568
Tell him I'll pay for him.

1375
01:33:36,735 --> 01:33:41,073
But when I sell him back for twice the
amount next year, I keep the money.

1376
01:33:43,033 --> 01:33:46,036
Okay, so Billy says
he'll pay for Rincon himself.

1377
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:50,499
But when he sells him for more money
next year, he's keeping the profit.

1378
01:34:00,425 --> 01:34:03,137
Thank you very much.
We'll call you back. Thank you.

1379
01:34:03,303 --> 01:34:05,931
Come on. Come on.

1380
01:34:11,061 --> 01:34:14,898
Suzanne, call Shapiro Ba...
Never mind, I got him right here.

1381
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:19,486
Mark. Yeah.

1382
01:34:19,653 --> 01:34:22,573
Listen, I don't want Rincon
pitching against me tonight.

1383
01:34:22,739 --> 01:34:26,243
Tell him to change clothes and
send him over. I got you the money.

1384
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:27,828
Yup.

1385
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,413
Great.

1386
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:37,588
I don't wanna dampen the mood at all,
but since we picked up Rincon...

1387
01:34:37,754 --> 01:34:40,007
We gotta send someone down.

1388
01:34:46,722 --> 01:34:49,766
- Mags.
- Hey, Billy.

1389
01:34:52,728 --> 01:34:54,605
I know I've been struggling lately.

1390
01:34:54,771 --> 01:34:58,525
But second half of the season,
definitely turn it around. Ricky and I...

1391
01:34:58,692 --> 01:35:02,613
Mike, I need you
to stop getting dressed.

1392
01:35:05,157 --> 01:35:06,783
Traded?

1393
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:20,047
I'm sorry for the crap news.

1394
01:35:20,797 --> 01:35:22,758
I know it hurts.

1395
01:35:32,976 --> 01:35:35,812
Mike, I can't have 26 guys
in the clubhouse.

1396
01:35:35,979 --> 01:35:38,941
I get it. I get it.

1397
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:43,362
Okay. Thanks.

1398
01:35:57,626 --> 01:35:59,711
Hey, Ricardo.

1399
01:36:01,129 --> 01:36:03,757
This must be a bit of a shock,
I guess.

1400
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:06,677
<i>Mabry hits one
deep to right-center field.</i>

1401
01:36:06,843 --> 01:36:08,845
<i>Racing back, Fick can't get it.</i>

1402
01:36:09,012 --> 01:36:12,641
<i>It bounces to the wall.
One run is in. Two runs are in.</i>

1403
01:36:13,058 --> 01:36:16,353
<i>Mabry, on one pitch,</i>
<i>has shot the A's in front.</i>

1404
01:36:17,729 --> 01:36:20,857
<i>Strike three called.
Twelve straight wins for the Athletics.</i>

1405
01:36:21,024 --> 01:36:22,442
<i>Man alive, was it hairy.</i>

1406
01:36:22,609 --> 01:36:25,028
<i>Something strange is now happening
in Oakland.</i>

1407
01:36:25,195 --> 01:36:27,614
<i>- You cannot argue that point.
- Twelve straight.</i>

1408
01:36:27,781 --> 01:36:30,701
<i>They're making a joke
out of the American League.</i>

1409
01:36:30,867 --> 01:36:33,453
<i>- They were in Detroit today...
- He throws to first.</i>

1410
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:37,165
<i>And that's the sound
of 14 straight victories.</i>

1411
01:36:37,332 --> 01:36:39,376
Fourteen, the longest run this year.

1412
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:42,212
<i>It has slingshot the A's into first</i>
<i>in the AL West.</i>

1413
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:44,631
<i>- A nice streak.
- This team was written off.</i>

1414
01:36:44,798 --> 01:36:48,260
<i>How do you explain, otherwise,
the victories they've come up with?</i>

1415
01:36:48,427 --> 01:36:51,972
<i>The Oakland A's are gonna win
16 consecutive games.</i>

1416
01:36:53,015 --> 01:36:57,853
<i>This is the longest win streak
in baseball, folks, in 25 years.</i>

1417
01:36:59,896 --> 01:37:03,817
<i>- The A's have won 16 in a row.
- We're going to 20! We're going to 20!</i>

1418
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:08,238
<i>To have a winning streak of
this duration, you have to be good...</i>

1419
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:11,325
<i>but there's an element
of randomness to it.</i>

1420
01:37:11,491 --> 01:37:13,702
<i>The 1927 Yankees, Ruth, Gehrig...</i>

1421
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:16,997
<i>Murderers' Row, some people
still say the best team ever.</i>

1422
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:20,709
<i>Longest winning streak
for them that year? Nine.</i>

1423
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:23,879
<i>You guys try to analyze it
from a numbers standpoint.</i>

1424
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:28,091
<i>I'm telling you, there is no explanation
for what's occurring right now.</i>

1425
01:37:28,258 --> 01:37:30,093
<i>Do you have superstitions
going on?</i>

1426
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:32,637
<i>Do you do things
so you keep the streak alive?</i>

1427
01:37:32,804 --> 01:37:36,350
<i>The all-time record of 20
does not seem impossible anymore.</i>

1428
01:37:36,516 --> 01:37:38,852
<i>The A's were on page one</i>
<i>of the</i> New York Times.

1429
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:42,397
<i>They are the story in sports
in this entire country.</i>

1430
01:37:42,564 --> 01:37:43,940
<i>Two-two pitch, here it is.</i>

1431
01:37:44,107 --> 01:37:47,778
<i>Swing and a miss! Struck him out!
Number 17!</i>

1432
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:51,281
<i>It's taken 71 years.</i>

1433
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:54,368
<i>The Oakland A's</i>
<i>have tied the Philadelphia A's.</i>

1434
01:37:54,534 --> 01:37:58,455
<i>The all-time franchise record
17 straight...</i>

1435
01:37:58,622 --> 01:38:03,877
<i>and baseball's longest
winning streak since 1953.</i>

1436
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:07,964
<i>The A's are two wins away from
tying the American League record.</i>

1437
01:38:08,131 --> 01:38:13,804
<i>It's gone! It's gone!
Tejada wins it! Do you believe it?</i>

1438
01:38:14,304 --> 01:38:16,473
<i>Eighteen wins in a row!</i>

1439
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,559
<i>You could replay these 18 games
a hundred times over.</i>

1440
01:38:19,726 --> 01:38:21,645
<i>And nobody wins 18 straight again.</i>

1441
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:24,356
<i>It defies everything we know
about baseball.</i>

1442
01:38:25,899 --> 01:38:28,151
<i>The most amazing thing
you could imagine...</i>

1443
01:38:28,318 --> 01:38:31,279
<i>happened over the last four days
at the Coliseum.</i>

1444
01:38:31,446 --> 01:38:36,993
<i>Tejada, up the middle.
The A's have won 19 in a row!</i>

1445
01:38:37,911 --> 01:38:40,497
<i>The 1906 White Sox...</i>

1446
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:44,668
<i>the 1947 New York Yankees
have company.</i>

1447
01:38:45,919 --> 01:38:50,507
- <i>Nineteen in a row.</i>
- <i>The A's have a date with destiny.</i>

1448
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:53,718
<i>They're going for the all-time
American League record...</i>

1449
01:38:53,885 --> 01:38:55,011
<i>20 games in a row.</i>

1450
01:38:55,178 --> 01:38:56,179
<i>We're going to 20!</i>

1451
01:38:56,346 --> 01:38:59,474
<i>We're gonna take the AL record
to 20, baby!</i>

1452
01:39:02,352 --> 01:39:04,187
<i>Don't tell me the score, Pete.</i>

1453
01:39:04,354 --> 01:39:05,564
<i>No, Billy, it's me.</i>

1454
01:39:05,730 --> 01:39:08,150
- Sharon?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1455
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:12,529
<i>- You have a second?</i>
- Yeah, what's up?

1456
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:15,073
<i>Well, I didn't actually expect you
to pick up.</i>

1457
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,242
<i>I was gonna leave a message.</i>

1458
01:39:18,076 --> 01:39:21,037
<i>Casey and I, we're here
and watching the game at home.</i>

1459
01:39:21,204 --> 01:39:24,875
<i>And I just wanted to say...</i>

1460
01:39:26,209 --> 01:39:27,961
<i>you did good, Billy.</i>

1461
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,172
<i>We're really proud of you.</i>

1462
01:39:31,673 --> 01:39:34,009
I appreciate it, Sharon.

1463
01:39:34,176 --> 01:39:37,053
- Thank you.
<i>- Good luck.</i>

1464
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:38,889
Okay.

1465
01:39:39,055 --> 01:39:41,391
<i>Oh, Casey wants to talk to you.
Hang on.</i>

1466
01:39:42,184 --> 01:39:43,977
<i>Are you on your way
to the stadium?</i>

1467
01:39:44,144 --> 01:39:47,189
No, I'm on my way to Visalia
to see our minor-league team.

1468
01:39:47,355 --> 01:39:50,108
- <i>Turn around, please, Dad.</i>
- No way, Jose.

1469
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:52,986
- <i>Turn around. Come on, Dad.</i>
- Nope. Not gonna happen.

1470
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,488
<i>You're not gonna jinx it.</i>

1471
01:39:54,654 --> 01:39:58,241
I'll talk to you later, sweetheart.
I love you.

1472
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:06,124
Shit.

1473
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:09,419
<i>One out here in the fourth,
and if you're just joining us...</i>

1474
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:10,670
<i>you missed a lot.</i>

1475
01:40:10,837 --> 01:40:13,882
<i>And the pitch to Raúl Ibañez.
Strike one.</i>

1476
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:15,759
<i>I think my recap will be simple.</i>

1477
01:40:15,926 --> 01:40:19,596
<i>The A's scored six in the first,
one in the second, four in the third.</i>

1478
01:40:19,763 --> 01:40:22,974
<i>And people would be shocked
if you just did that.</i>

1479
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:25,769
<i>Eleven to nothing, the A's do lead.</i>

1480
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:28,647
- Shit.
- <i>Foul</i> off <i>the foot of Ibañez.</i>...

1481
01:40:51,127 --> 01:40:53,755
<i>Let's go, Oakland!</i>

1482
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:56,466
<i>Let's go, Oakland!</i>

1483
01:40:56,633 --> 01:40:59,261
<i>Let's go, Oakland!</i>

1484
01:41:04,683 --> 01:41:10,814
Now batting, number 2,
catcher, Brent Mayne.

1485
01:41:14,943 --> 01:41:18,905
- Oakland!
- Here we go, Oakland!

1486
01:41:27,497 --> 01:41:29,082
Two.

1487
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:32,377
Safe.

1488
01:41:37,716 --> 01:41:40,677
Now batting, number 18...

1489
01:41:40,844 --> 01:41:45,015
left fielder Raúl Ibañez.

1490
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:47,786
Safe.

1491
01:42:50,205 --> 01:42:52,582
<i>And the A's now lead by a score</i>
<i>of 11 to 3.</i>

1492
01:42:52,749 --> 01:42:55,585
<i>A nice cushion,
but you don't wanna give teams life...</i>

1493
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:59,673
<i>and let them wedge their way
back in, even when you're...</i>

1494
01:43:42,424 --> 01:43:44,134
<i>Nobody out, the bases loaded.</i>

1495
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:47,637
<i>And Art Howe on the way to the
mound to make a pitching change.</i>

1496
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:49,723
<i>And this game is still in a state...</i>

1497
01:43:49,889 --> 01:43:52,809
<i>where it could get out of control
for the Athletics.</i>

1498
01:43:59,482 --> 01:44:02,736
<i>We're all told at some point we can
no longer play the children's game.</i>

1499
01:44:02,902 --> 01:44:06,489
<i>We just don't know
when that's gonna be.</i>

1500
01:44:10,076 --> 01:44:15,540
<i>Some of us are told at 18, some of us
are told at 40, but we're all told.</i>

1501
01:44:15,707 --> 01:44:18,042
<i>Mike Sweeney with runners
at first and third.</i>

1502
01:44:18,209 --> 01:44:20,628
<i>It's an 11-to-7 game,
the A's in front.</i>

1503
01:44:20,795 --> 01:44:23,506
<i>Tam peering in for the sign.</i>

1504
01:44:23,673 --> 01:44:26,676
<i>Two out. Runners at first and third.</i>

1505
01:44:26,843 --> 01:44:29,304
<i>And the 3-2 delivery.</i>

1506
01:45:03,046 --> 01:45:05,381
<i>It's weird, Billy.</i>

1507
01:45:05,548 --> 01:45:09,594
<i>You wanna give up baseball
to become a scout?</i>

1508
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:13,348
<i>I'm not a baseball player.</i>

1509
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:16,226
<i>Are you sure this is what you want?</i>

1510
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:22,148
<i>The crowd is roaring.
Koch is ready. One-two pitch.</i>

1511
01:45:22,607 --> 01:45:25,902
<i>Alicea puts it in play,
a looper to left field for a base hit.</i>

1512
01:45:26,069 --> 01:45:29,489
<i>Around third, tearing for the plate,
here comes the tying run.</i>

1513
01:45:29,697 --> 01:45:33,701
<i>Sliding safe.
And the ball game is tied at 11-all.</i>

1514
01:45:33,868 --> 01:45:35,495
<i>Holy Toledo.</i>

1515
01:45:36,788 --> 01:45:41,084
<i>The A's have blown
an 11-to-nothing lead.</i>

1516
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:46,923
<i>This is the specter of a development
that has been lurking now...</i>

1517
01:45:47,382 --> 01:45:51,511
<i>ever since the five-run fourth inning
by the Royals.</i>

1518
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:57,100
<i>And the A's date with destiny</i>
<i>is on hold right now.</i>

1519
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:25,962
Hatteberg. Hattie.

1520
01:46:26,462 --> 01:46:28,965
Grab a bat.
You're hitting for Byrnesy.

1521
01:46:30,466 --> 01:46:33,803
Come on, let's go.
Get yourself loose.

1522
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:48,026
Hitting for Eric Byrnes...

1523
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:52,363
number 10, Scott Hatteberg.

1524
01:47:00,496 --> 01:47:04,125
<i>In your typical A's fashion,</i>
<i>they want a base runner here.</i>

1525
01:47:04,292 --> 01:47:08,004
<i>Scott Hatteberg is so adept
at drawing walks.</i>

1526
01:47:11,215 --> 01:47:13,509
<i>He's looking for Hatteberg
to get on base...</i>

1527
01:47:13,676 --> 01:47:15,678
<i>maybe bring in a pinch runner.</i>

1528
01:47:15,845 --> 01:47:18,264
<i>Let's go, Oakland!</i>

1529
01:47:18,431 --> 01:47:20,516
<i>Let's go, Oakland!</i>

1530
01:48:15,321 --> 01:48:17,115
<i>That one is gone!</i>

1531
01:48:17,281 --> 01:48:21,744
<i>And it's 20 consecutive victories
for the Oakland Athletics...</i>

1532
01:48:21,911 --> 01:48:23,955
<i>on an unbelievable night...</i>

1533
01:48:24,122 --> 01:48:26,791
<i>when they lost
an 11-to-nothing lead...</i>

1534
01:48:26,958 --> 01:48:29,335
<i>and now they win it.</i>

1535
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:35,174
<i>The crowd comes back
to insane life.</i>

1536
01:48:37,093 --> 01:48:39,095
<i>How do you explain it?</i>

1537
01:48:40,054 --> 01:48:44,392
<i>Crazy. Just plain crazy.</i>

1538
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:52,066
<i>Hatteberg is mobbed at home plate.</i>

1539
01:48:55,278 --> 01:48:58,281
<i>In 103 years
of American League baseball...</i>

1540
01:48:58,448 --> 01:49:01,909
<i>the Athletics have accomplished
what no one has before.</i>

1541
01:49:02,076 --> 01:49:06,289
<i>They have won
20 consecutive games.</i>

1542
01:49:32,315 --> 01:49:35,109
<i>It's hard not to be romantic
about baseball.</i>

1543
01:49:36,986 --> 01:49:40,239
<i>This kind of thing,
it's fun for the fans.</i>

1544
01:49:41,157 --> 01:49:44,577
<i>It sells tickets and hot dogs.</i>

1545
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:47,497
<i>Doesn't mean anything.</i>

1546
01:49:47,663 --> 01:49:51,292
<i>Billy, we just won 20 games
in a row.</i>

1547
01:49:53,002 --> 01:49:55,046
And what's the point?

1548
01:49:55,213 --> 01:49:57,882
We just got the record.

1549
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:03,179
Man, I've been doing this for...

1550
01:50:09,185 --> 01:50:11,270
Listen, man.

1551
01:50:11,437 --> 01:50:14,899
I've been in this game a long time.

1552
01:50:16,526 --> 01:50:19,278
I'm not in it for a record,
I'll tell you that.

1553
01:50:19,445 --> 01:50:21,572
I'm not in it for a ring.

1554
01:50:24,242 --> 01:50:26,494
That's when people get hurt.

1555
01:50:28,121 --> 01:50:31,040
If we don't win the last game
of the Series...

1556
01:50:32,291 --> 01:50:34,335
they'll dismiss us.

1557
01:50:34,877 --> 01:50:36,337
- Billy...
- I know these guys.

1558
01:50:36,504 --> 01:50:39,382
I know the way they think,
and they will erase us.

1559
01:50:40,883 --> 01:50:43,386
And everything we've done here...

1560
01:50:43,553 --> 01:50:45,471
none of it'll matter.

1561
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:51,894
Any other team wins the World Series,
good for them.

1562
01:50:53,062 --> 01:50:56,399
They're drinking champagne,
they get a ring.

1563
01:50:56,566 --> 01:50:58,526
But if we win...

1564
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,779
on our budget, with this team...

1565
01:51:05,575 --> 01:51:07,618
we'll have changed the game.

1566
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:10,580
And that's what I want.

1567
01:51:10,746 --> 01:51:12,999
I want it to mean something.

1568
01:51:22,633 --> 01:51:25,761
<i>The A's going to the play-offs
with the West Division title.</i>

1569
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:29,682
<i>Forgive the A's</i>
<i>if they're not celebrating.</i>

1570
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:31,392
<i>They have been here before...</i>

1571
01:51:31,559 --> 01:51:35,271
<i>when Oakland went up two games
to none on the Yanks in the ALDS...</i>

1572
01:51:35,438 --> 01:51:37,940
<i>and went nowhere
after losing three straight.</i>

1573
01:51:38,107 --> 01:51:41,444
<i>With a win today over the Twins,
Oakland moves into the ALCS...</i>

1574
01:51:41,611 --> 01:51:44,947
<i>- for the first time since 1992.
- But remember one thing.</i>

1575
01:51:46,324 --> 01:51:50,161
<i>Percentages hold up over a season,
but for one game, one at bat...</i>

1576
01:51:50,328 --> 01:51:52,872
<i>throw the percentages
out the window.</i>

1577
01:52:25,655 --> 01:52:30,201
<i>What the Minnesota Twins exposed
is the fact that the Oakland A's...</i>

1578
01:52:30,368 --> 01:52:34,163
<i>were fundamentally
not a sound baseball team.</i>

1579
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:37,833
<i>They had a flawed concept that
started with the general manager...</i>

1580
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,504
<i>and the brain trust
thinking they could reinvent baseball.</i>

1581
01:52:41,671 --> 01:52:43,256
<i>You can't approach baseball...</i>

1582
01:52:43,422 --> 01:52:46,092
<i>from a statistical,
bean-counting point of view.</i>

1583
01:52:46,259 --> 01:52:48,511
<i>It's won on the field
with fundamental play.</i>

1584
01:52:48,678 --> 01:52:51,764
<i>You have to steal, you have to bunt,
you have to sacrifice.</i>

1585
01:52:51,931 --> 01:52:55,518
<i>You gotta get men in scoring position,
and you gotta bring them in.</i>

1586
01:52:55,685 --> 01:53:00,147
<i>And you don't do that
with a bunch of statistical gimmicks.</i>

1587
01:53:00,314 --> 01:53:03,150
<i>Nobody reinvents this game.</i>

1588
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:47,778
Yeah.

1589
01:54:56,305 --> 01:55:01,811
Due respect to the Coliseum,
but this is a ballpark.

1590
01:55:01,977 --> 01:55:03,979
Yes, it is.

1591
01:55:06,065 --> 01:55:08,317
We're gonna have some lunch
in a little bit.

1592
01:55:08,484 --> 01:55:10,736
Why don't I have some coffee
sent up?

1593
01:55:11,404 --> 01:55:13,155
Denise?

1594
01:55:17,785 --> 01:55:19,662
Thank you, Denise.

1595
01:55:19,829 --> 01:55:21,872
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1596
01:55:24,834 --> 01:55:28,504
You know, it's her birthday
and I need to get her a present...

1597
01:55:28,671 --> 01:55:31,632
but she's usually the one
that does that for me.

1598
01:55:32,341 --> 01:55:34,677
So do you have any ideas?

1599
01:55:35,219 --> 01:55:36,595
Scarf.

1600
01:55:36,762 --> 01:55:38,222
You mean like wool?

1601
01:55:38,389 --> 01:55:43,352
No, I meant what women wear with...
You know, decorative.

1602
01:55:43,727 --> 01:55:46,522
And where would I get something
like that?

1603
01:55:47,481 --> 01:55:50,818
No disrespect, I just lost in five
for the second year in a row.

1604
01:55:50,985 --> 01:55:53,320
Get her a bowling ball for all I care.

1605
01:55:53,487 --> 01:55:54,864
Right.

1606
01:55:55,781 --> 01:55:59,326
Well, Steve told me he's offering you
a new contract.

1607
01:56:00,786 --> 01:56:02,496
Yes.

1608
01:56:02,663 --> 01:56:05,332
So why did you return my call?

1609
01:56:07,418 --> 01:56:10,004
Because it's the Red Sox.

1610
01:56:10,171 --> 01:56:14,717
Because I believe science might offer
an answer to the Curse of the Bambino.

1611
01:56:15,384 --> 01:56:20,681
- Because I hear you hired Bill James.
- Yup.

1612
01:56:20,848 --> 01:56:25,561
You know, why someone took so long
to hire that guy is beyond me.

1613
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,856
Well, baseball hates him.

1614
01:56:29,398 --> 01:56:34,111
Well, baseball can hate him,
you know.

1615
01:56:34,278 --> 01:56:38,240
One of the great things about money
is that it buys a lot of things...

1616
01:56:38,407 --> 01:56:41,952
one of which is the luxury
to disregard what baseball likes...

1617
01:56:42,119 --> 01:56:45,080
doesn't like, what baseball thinks,
doesn't think.

1618
01:56:47,374 --> 01:56:49,335
Sounds nice.

1619
01:56:52,087 --> 01:56:54,131
Well, I was grateful for the call.

1620
01:56:54,298 --> 01:56:56,175
- You were grateful?
- Yeah.

1621
01:56:59,428 --> 01:57:03,307
For 41 million,
you built a play-off team.

1622
01:57:03,474 --> 01:57:07,770
You lost Damon, Giambi,
Isringhausen, Peña...

1623
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:11,607
and you won more games
without them than you did with them.

1624
01:57:11,774 --> 01:57:15,194
You won the exact same number
of games that the Yankees won...

1625
01:57:15,361 --> 01:57:19,281
but the Yankees spent 1 .4 million
per win...

1626
01:57:19,448 --> 01:57:22,910
and you paid 260,000.

1627
01:57:23,077 --> 01:57:27,122
I know you're taking it in the teeth,
but the first guy through the wall...

1628
01:57:27,581 --> 01:57:29,750
he always gets bloody.

1629
01:57:29,917 --> 01:57:33,295
Always. This is threatening
not just a way of doing business...

1630
01:57:33,462 --> 01:57:36,006
but in their minds,
it's threatening the game.

1631
01:57:36,173 --> 01:57:39,468
Really, what it's threatening
is their livelihood, their jobs.

1632
01:57:39,635 --> 01:57:42,638
It's threatening the way
that they do things.

1633
01:57:42,805 --> 01:57:44,181
Every time that happens...

1634
01:57:44,348 --> 01:57:47,851
whether it's a government,
a way of doing business, whatever...

1635
01:57:48,018 --> 01:57:50,563
the people
who are holding the reins...

1636
01:57:50,729 --> 01:57:53,315
they have their hands
on the switch...

1637
01:57:53,482 --> 01:57:55,985
they go batshit crazy.

1638
01:57:56,986 --> 01:58:01,824
I mean, anybody who's not
tearing their team down right now...

1639
01:58:01,991 --> 01:58:05,119
and rebuilding it
using your model...

1640
01:58:05,995 --> 01:58:07,830
they're dinosaurs.

1641
01:58:08,414 --> 01:58:12,835
They'll be sitting on their ass
on the sofa in October...

1642
01:58:13,002 --> 01:58:16,505
watching the Boston Red Sox
win the World Series.

1643
01:58:21,885 --> 01:58:23,804
What's this?

1644
01:58:23,971 --> 01:58:27,474
I want you to be my general manager.
That's my offer.

1645
01:59:14,396 --> 01:59:15,898
Heads up.

1646
01:59:17,566 --> 01:59:18,567
What was that?

1647
01:59:19,818 --> 01:59:22,905
- Sorry. I don't know.
- What the hell was that?

1648
01:59:23,572 --> 01:59:25,908
You knucklehead.

1649
01:59:33,415 --> 01:59:34,750
How was Boston?

1650
01:59:36,293 --> 01:59:38,212
Impressive.

1651
01:59:44,635 --> 01:59:47,262
Did Henry make you a good offer,
at least?

1652
01:59:48,806 --> 01:59:51,892
- Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
- What was it? What was it?

1653
01:59:52,059 --> 01:59:53,686
- Doesn't matter.
- What was it?

1654
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:20,254
That makes you the highest-paid GM
in the history of sports.

1655
02:00:22,673 --> 02:00:24,133
So?

1656
02:00:25,968 --> 02:00:27,177
So what?

1657
02:00:30,222 --> 02:00:32,683
I made one decision in my life
based on money.

1658
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:35,811
And I swore
I would never do it again.

1659
02:00:38,397 --> 02:00:40,441
You're not doing it for the money.

1660
02:00:40,941 --> 02:00:43,444
- No?
- No.

1661
02:00:45,446 --> 02:00:47,990
You're doing it
for what the money says.

1662
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:53,120
And it says what it says to any player
that makes big money.

1663
02:00:53,787 --> 02:00:55,539
That they're worth it.

1664
02:01:04,006 --> 02:01:05,716
What a dump.

1665
02:01:09,887 --> 02:01:12,222
I really wanted to win here.

1666
02:01:16,268 --> 02:01:18,812
I really did.

1667
02:01:21,315 --> 02:01:23,484
I think you won pretty big, Billy.

1668
02:01:24,318 --> 02:01:26,445
Pete, we lost.

1669
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:30,616
We lost.

1670
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:34,244
It's only been a few days.
Give yourself some time to get over it.

1671
02:01:34,411 --> 02:01:39,041
Man, I don't get over these things.
Ever.

1672
02:01:46,048 --> 02:01:49,718
Come with me to the video room.
I wanna show you something.

1673
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:54,765
No, man,
I'm not up for film right now.

1674
02:01:56,016 --> 02:01:58,101
Come on. Seriously.

1675
02:01:58,268 --> 02:02:00,437
Come on, Billy. Come on.

1676
02:02:02,147 --> 02:02:03,273
The Visalia Oaks...

1677
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:06,235
and our 240-pound catcher,
Jeremy Brown...

1678
02:02:06,401 --> 02:02:10,030
who, as you know,
is scared to run to second base.

1679
02:02:10,197 --> 02:02:11,990
This was in a game six weeks ago.

1680
02:02:12,574 --> 02:02:14,701
This guy's gonna start
with a fastball.

1681
02:02:14,868 --> 02:02:17,287
Jeremy's gonna take him
to deep center.

1682
02:02:19,456 --> 02:02:20,958
Here's what's interesting...

1683
02:02:21,124 --> 02:02:24,002
because Jeremy's gonna do
what he never does.

1684
02:02:24,169 --> 02:02:25,462
He's gonna go for it.

1685
02:02:25,629 --> 02:02:28,882
He's gonna round first
and he's gonna go for it.

1686
02:02:30,092 --> 02:02:31,385
Okay?

1687
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:39,643
This is all of Jeremy's nightmares
coming to life.

1688
02:02:42,271 --> 02:02:45,524
- They're laughing at him.
- And Jeremy's about to find out why.

1689
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:51,071
Jeremy's about to realize...

1690
02:02:52,531 --> 02:02:55,659
that the ball went 60 feet
over the fence.

1691
02:02:58,287 --> 02:03:01,915
He hit a home run
and didn't even realize it.

1692
02:03:31,904 --> 02:03:34,948
How can you not be romantic
about baseball?

1693
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:42,789
- It's a metaphor.
- I know it's a metaphor.

1694
02:03:47,502 --> 02:03:48,879
Okay.

1695
02:03:52,966 --> 02:03:56,011
Pete, you're a good egg.

1696
02:03:59,431 --> 02:04:01,183
I'll call you.

1697
02:05:01,994 --> 02:05:05,580
<i>Hey, Dad, this is the song I told you
I'd record.</i>

1698
02:05:05,747 --> 02:05:08,458
<i>Please don't show it to anyone else.</i>

1699
02:05:08,625 --> 02:05:11,712
<i>Let me know if you change your mind
and stay in California.</i>

1700
02:05:11,878 --> 02:05:14,923
<i>If not, you're a really great dad.</i>
